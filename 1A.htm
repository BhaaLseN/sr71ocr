    <h3>SR-71 Trainer</h3>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This subsection of Section I describes the SR-71B trainer aircraft. The normal and emergency operating procedures, limitations, and performance data for this aircraft are included in the appropriate sections of the SR-71A-1 Flight Manual. The aircraft systems and controls are identical with the like systems and controls in the SR-71 A aircraft except as indicated in the following paragraphs. The controls and indicators in the aft cockpit are identical with the like controls in the forward cockpit except as indicated.</p>

      <h1>The SR-71B Aircraft</h1>
      <p>The SR-71B is a trainer aircraft with a full set of engine and flight controls in the aft cockpit. For pilot training purposes, the student pilot (S/P) occupies the forward cockpit and the instructor pilot (I/P) occupies the aft cockpit. For other than training flights the pilot will normally occupy the forward cockpit.</p>
      <p>The forward cockpit of the SR-71B appears identical to the forward cockpit of an SR-71A except for the addition of a control transfer panel, an emergency intercom system switch, a panel to indicate autopilot modes selected by the other cockpit, ALERT AND BAILOUT warning lights, and the lack of a TACAN CONT switch and a system 3 liquid nitrogen gage. The aft cockpit duplicates most of the functions in the forward cockpit and retains basic navigational capabilities. The trainer does not have camera equipment, viewsight, radar, or electromagnetic radiation gear. The trainer external configuration is distinguished by a stabilizing fin extending downward along the bottom centerline of each engine nacelle, and the aft cockpit canopy is higher than the forward cockpit canopy.</p>

      <h1>Engine and Afterburner</h1>
      <p>Two throttles are installed in each cockpit. The throttles are interconnected by a cable system which provides each cockpit with the capability of controlling engines from idle cutoff to maximum afterburner.</p>
      <h2>TEB Remaining Counters</h2>
      <p>The TEB counters are installed only on the throttle quadrant in the forward cockpit.</p>
      <h2>EGT Gages</h2>
      <p>There are two EGT gages, one for each engine, in each cockpit. The two gages in the aft cockpit repeat the forward cockpit temperature indications but do not affect the operation of the fuel derich system. The fuel derich system is actuated only by the forward cockpit gage indications. Because of gage tolerances, the rear cockpit gages can indicate as much as 16°C different from the forward cockpit gages. HOT and COLD flag indicators in each cockpit independently display signals from the automatic EGT control system. The over-temperature warning light in each gage operates independently.</p>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>The fuel derich system is activated only by the forward cockpit gage indications. Failure of a forward cockpit EGT gage results in loss of derich protection for the respective engine.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>EGT Trim Switches</h2>
      <p>EGT trim switches are installed in both cockpits. Operation of the aft cockpit switches out of the center position (marked HOLD &amp; FWD CONT) overrides the switch positions in the forward cockpit.</p>
      <h2>Fuel Derich Arming Switch</h2>
      <p>A fuel derich arming switch is installed in each cockpit. Only the switch in the cockpit with the FUEL CONT transfer light illuminated on the control transfer panel is functional.</p>
      <h2>Fuel Derich System Test Switch</h2>
      <p>A fuel derich test switch is installed in the forward cockpit only. During the derich system test the aft cockpit EGT gages indicate only 200°C above the nominal EGT indication.</p>
      <h2>Fuel Derich Warning Light</h2>
      <p>Two fuel derich warning lights, one for each engine, are installed in each cockpit. The aft cockpit lights repeat the forward cockpit lights and are not affected by aft cockpit EGT indications.</p>
      <h2>IGV Lockout Switches</h2>
      <p>IGV lockout switches are installed in the forward cockpit only. IGV position lights are installed in each cockpit.</p>
      <h2>Igniter Purge Switch</h2>
      <p>The igniter purge switch is installed in the forward cockpit only.</p>

      <h2>Inlet Aft Bypass Switches and Indicators</h2>
      <p>The aft bypass control switches and indicator lights are installed in both cockpits. The aft cockpit switches have an extra position, labeled FWD CONTROL, which allows the forward cockpit to control the aft bypass doors. Operation of the switches in the aft cockpit out of the FWD CONTROL position overrides the switch positions in the forward cockpit.</p>
      <h2>Spike and Forward Bypass Control Knobs</h2>
      <p>The four rotary knobs for spike and forward bypass control are only functional in the cockpit with the SPIKE DOOR transfer light illuminated on the control transfer panel.</p>
      <h2>Inlet Restart Switches</h2>
      <p>The forward cockpit restart switches are only functional when the forward cockpit has the SPIKE DOOR transfer light illuminated on the control transfer panel. The RESTART ON position of either aft cockpit restart switch: puts the corresponding inlet in restart; overrides the SPIKE DOOR transfer switches to put the aft cockpit in control of the spikes and forward bypass doors of both inlets, regardless of which cockpit previously had SPIKE DOOR control; and illuminates the MANUAL INLET caution lights in both cockpits and the SPIKE DOOR transfer light on the aft cockpit control transfer panel. When both aft cockpit restart switches are returned to the OFF position, spike and forward bypass control as well as SPIKE DOOR transfer light illumination reverts to the cockpit selected on the control transfer panel.</p>
      <h2>Throttle Restart Switch</h2>
      <p>The forward cockpit throttle restart switch is only functional when the forward cockpit has SPIKE DOOR control. The aft cockpit throttle restart switch, when armed, is always functional. In addition, positioning the aft cockpit throttle restart switch out of the OFF position overrides the SPIKE DOOR transfer switches to put the aft cockpit in control of the spikes as well as the forward bypass doors of both inlets regardless of which cockpit previously had SPIKE DOOR control, and illuminates the MANUAL INLET caution lights in both cockpits and the SPIKE DOOR transfer light on the aft cockpit control transfer panel. When the aft cockpit throttle restart switch is returned to the OFF position, spike and forward bypass control as well as SPIKE DOOR transfer light illumination reverts to the cockpit selected on the control transfer panel.</p>
      <h2>Throttle Restart Arming Switch</h2>
      <p>A throttle restart arming switch is installed in each cockpit. Each restart arming switch operates independently from the other.</p>
      <h2>Manual Inlet Indicator Light</h2>
      <p>The MANUAL INLET lights on the annunciator panels in both cockpits illuminate simultaneously when: the crewmember with SPIKE DOOR control moves one or more of the four rotary spike and/or forward bypass control switches out of the AUTO position; the crewmember with SPIKE DOOR control moves any inlet restart switch out of the OFF position regardless of which cockpit previously had SPIKE DOOR control.</p>

      <h1>Fuel Supply System</h1>
      <h3>Fuel System Controls, Instruments and Indicator Lights</h3>
      <h4>Crossfeed Switch</h4>
      <p>The cockpits have independent operation of the crossfeed switch, but actual control of the crossfeed valves (and the X-FEED and OPEN light indications in both cockpits) is retained by the cockpit that has the FUEL CONT transfer light illuminated on the control transfer panel. When control of the fuel system is transferred, the crossfeed valve assumes the position commanded in the cockpit taking control.</p>
      <h4>Fuel Boost Pump Switches and Indicator Lights</h4>
      <p>Identical square fuel boost pump switches are installed in each cockpit. Manual boost pump control and the pump release switch are only functional in the cockpit that has the FUEL CONT transfer light illuminated on the control transfer panel. Numerals showing boost pump relays actuated and tank EMPTY lights appear simultaneously in both cockpits, thus providing monitoring of fuel sequencing to both cockpits. When control of the fuel system is transferred, fuel sequencing reverts to automatic, even though it may have been manually supplemented previously. If manual sequencing is desired by the cockpit taking control, boost pump switches must again be manually depressed.</p>
      <h4>Tank Lights Test Switch</h4>
      <p>The square push-button tank lights TEST switch below the pump release switch in each cockpit tests only the lights in that cockpit. The switch works regardless of which cockpit has the FUEL CONT transfer light illuminated on the control transfer panel.</p>
      <h4>Forward Fuel Transfer Switch</h4>
      <p>A two-position forward transfer switch is installed in each cockpit.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Either cockpit can initiate forward fuel transfer regardless of which cockpit has the FUEL CONT light illuminated on the transfer control panel. Both switches must be off to terminate transfer.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Aft Transfer Switch</h4>
      <p>An aft transfer switch is installed in each cockpit. Both switches must be off to terminate transfer.</p>
      <h4>Fuel Dump Switch</h4>
      <p>A fuel dump switch is installed in each cockpit.</p>

        <p>Operating either fuel dump switch to the FUEL DUMP position will open the fuel dump valves regardless of which cockpit has the FUEL CONT Light illuminated on the transfer control panel. Operating either switch to the EMER DUMP position will dump all remaining fuel. Both switches must be off to terminate dumping.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Emergency Fuel Shutoff Switch</h4>
      <p>Emergency Fuel Shutoff switches are installed in each cockpit. Operating either switch to off (up) shuts off the fuel to the respective engine.</p>
      <h4>Fuel Quantity Selector Switch</h4>
      <p>A fuel quantity selector switch is installed on the right console in the forward cockpit and on the lower portion of the instrument panel in the aft cockpit. Operation of a fuel quantity selector switch and its respective quantity indicator is independent of the selector switch and indicator in the other cockpit.</p>
      <h4>Liquid Nitrogen Quantity Indicator</h4>
      <p>A liquid nitrogen quantity indicator is installed in the forward cockpit only. System 3 liquid nitrogen system and indicator are not installed.</p>
      <h4>Air Refuel Ready Switch</h4>
      <p>An air refuel ready switch is installed in each cockpit. Positioning this aft cockpit air refuel switch out of the OFF position overrides the forward cockpit switch positions.</p>
      <h4>Air Refuel Reset Switch and Indicator Light</h4>
      <p>A square, air refuel mechanism resetting push-button, is located on each instrument panel. The switches operate in parallel, so that depressing either switch will reset the signal amplifier and recycle the refueling receptacle locking mechanism.</p>
      <h4>Disconnect Trigger Switch</h4>
      <p>A disconnect trigger switch is installed on each control stick grip. Depressing either trigger switch will initiate a refueling disconnect. Depressing either trigger opens the receptacle latches during air refueling using manual override.</p>

      <h1>Landing Gear System</h1>
      <p>The landing gear is controlled from the forward cockpit by a landing gear lever, and from the aft cockpit by a switch.</p>
      <h2>Landing Gear Lever</h2>
      <p>A landing gear lever is located in the forward cockpit only.</p>
      <h2>Landing Gear Switch</h2>
      <p>A guarded, lock-wired, three-position toggle switch for operating the landing gear is located on the lower left side of the instrument panel in the aft cockpit. The UP (up) and DOWN (down) positions of the switch override the position of the landing gear lever in the forward cockpit. After use, if the switch is returned to OFF (center) and the landing gear lever in the forward cockpit is not in agreement with the actual position of the landing gear, the gear position does not change but hydraulic pressure and electrical command of gear position is removed from the landing gear system. If the switch is returned to OFF and the landing gear lever in the forward cockpit is in the position of the landing gear or is moved to the position of the landing gear, the landing gear lever and system again become operative. The switch is normally lock-wired in the OFF position and must be in that position for normal gear operation from the forward cockpit. Location of the switch in its center position can be verified by noting the appearance of a yellow dot in the end of the switch which should be visible through an aperture in the guard when it is lowered.</p>
      <h2>Manual Landing Gear Release Handle</h2>
      <p>A manual landing gear release handle is installed in each cockpit; the two handles are interconnected mechanically and pulling either handle will release the landing gear latches.</p>
      <h2>Landing Gear Warning Cutout Button</h2>
      <p>A landing gear warning cutout push-button is installed in each cockpit. Depressing the button in either cockpit will disable the warning circuit in both cockpits.</p>
      <h2>Gear Unsafe Warning Light</h2>
      <p>The gear unsafe warning light, labeled GEAR NOT LOCKED, is located on the lower left portion of the instrument panel in the aft cockpit only. The light functions similarly to the light in the gear handle in the forward cockpit, lighting red whenever the gear is not in the position called for by the gear handle position or the aft cockpit landing gear switch.</p>

      <h1>Drag Chute System</h1>
      <p>Normal and emergency deployment of the drag chute can be initiated from either cockpit.</p>
      <h2>Drag Chute Switch</h2>
      <p>A guarded three-position DRAG CHUTE switch is provided in the upper left side of the instrument panel in the aft cockpit. (See Figure 1A-10.) Its guarded OFF (center) position corresponds to the stowed position of the drag chute handle in the forward cockpit. The guard must be raised to move the switch to the CHUTE DEPLOY (up) position, or to the CHUTE JETTISON (down) position. The switch is automatically reset to the OFF position when the guard is lowered. Location of the switch in its center position can be verified by noting the appearance of a yellow dot in the end of the switch which should be visible through an aperture in the guard when it is lowered. The control in the aft cockpit can always be used to operate the drag chute mechanism. The aft cockpit switch must be placed in its guarded OFF position to transfer control of the drag chute mechanism to the forward cockpit crewmember for normal deployment or jettisoning.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>If the aft cockpit deploys the drag chute and the forward cockpit handle remains stowed, returning the aft cockpit drag chute switch to OFF will jettison the drag chute.</p>

      <h5>NAV/TAC/ILS INSTR Control</h5>
      <p>The cockpit with the NAV/TAC/ILS INSTR transfer light illuminated has control of the Display Mode Select switch, Bearing Select switch, HSI Course and Heading Set knobs, and the TACAN and ILS control panels. The ADI steering commands and HSI displays selected by the controlling cockpit are repeated in the other cockpit.</p>
      <h5>Fuel System Control</h5>
      <p>The cockpit with the FUEL CONT transfer light illuminated has control of those components within the fuel system that are operated manually: derich, crossfeed, boost pumps and pump release.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>When control of the fuel system is transferred, fuel sequencing reverts to automatic, even though it may have been manually supplemented previously. If manual sequencing is desired by the cockpit taking control, boost pump switches must again be manually depressed.</p>
        <p>The crossfeed valve assumes the position commanded in the cockpit taking control.</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Inlet Spike and Forward Bypass Control</h5>
      <p>The cockpit with the SPIKE DOOR transfer light illuminated has control of the inlet spike and forward bypass door control knobs. The forward cockpit restart switches and throttle restart switch are only functional when the forward cockpit has SPIKE DOOR control.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>When out of the OFF position, either aft cockpit restart switch or the aft cockpit throttle restart switch overrides the SPIKE DOOR transfer switch to put the aft cockpit in control of the spikes and forward bypass doors of both inlets and illuminates the MANUAL INLET caution lights in both cockpits and the SPIKE DOOR transfer light on the aft cockpit control transfer panel. When all aft restart switches are returned to the OFF position, SPIKE DOOR control as well as SPIKE DOOR transfer light illumination reverts to the cockpit selected on the control transfer panel.</p>
      </div>
      <h5>Automatic Flight Control System Control</h5>
      <p>The cockpit with the AFCS transfer light illuminated has control of the stability augmentation system, autopilot controls, and the DAFICS Preflight BIT switch.</p>

      <h1>Astroinertial Navigation System</h1>
      <p>The Astroinertial Navigation System (ANS) control panel is located on the right console in the aft cockpit. Navigational accuracy may be degraded to the extent that position accuracy cannot be updated by reference to viewsight and radar system data.</p>
      <p>Star tracking may be degraded because the field of view of the astrotracker is reduced by the position of the astrotracker window behind the aft canopy.</p>

      <h1>Mission Recorder</h1>
      <p>The mission recorder is controlled by a square, self-illuminated, push-button switch labeled MRS on the top half of the push-button and located on the right console in the aft cockpit. Depressing the push-button turns on the mission recorder, illuminating the lower left quarter of the push-button ON in green: depressing a lighted push-button turns off the recorder. In case a failure occurs in the 28-VDC or 400-cycle power supply to the recorder, the bottom right quarter of the push-button face lights FAIL in red. If power is subsequently restored the recorder will resume operation; however, the FAIL light will not go out, having to be reset on the ground.</p>

      <h1>Egress Coordination System</h1>
      <p>The bailout switch located on the left side of the instrument panel in the forward cockpit is labeled RSO (rear seat occupant) BAILOUT; the bailout switch in the corresponding location in the aft cockpit is labeled S/P (student pilot) BAILOUT. Each switch is covered by a red guard and has three positions, OFF (center), ALERT (down), and GO (up). An ALERT and BAILOUT light are located on the left side of the instrument panel in both cockpits. Operating either bailout switch to the GO position causes the BAILOUT light in the other cockpit to illuminate. Operating either switch to the ALERT position illuminates the ALERT light in the other cockpit. The bailout switch is normally in the OFF position, with the guard down. When the aft cockpit seat ejects, RSO EJECTED illuminates in the forward cockpit, signifying that the forward cockpit pilot may eject safely; if the forward cockpit seat ejects first, the rear seat occupant must rely on sound and vision to determine when the forward seat is gone.</p>

      <h1>Emergency Warning Equipment</h1>
      <h3>Master Warning System</h3>
      <p>The annunciator panel lights in the aft cockpit duplicate all the warnings and cautions displayed on the forward cockpit annunciator panel except one. The WINDSHIELD DEICE ON annunciator caution light is only installed in the forward cockpit.</p>
      <h4>Master Warning and Master Caution Lights</h4>
      <p>Depressing the master warning or master caution light extinguishes the master caution or warning light and causes the associated annunciator light to illuminate steady in that cockpit only.</p>
      <p>A supplementary post-type warning and master caution light is located at the top of the instrument panel in the aft cockpit. These lights are fitted with a plastic lighttube so that they are visible when the canopy is down and the seat is in an elevated position.</p>
      <h4>Indicators and Warning Lights Test Button</h4>
      <p>The indicator and warning lights test button, labeled IND &amp; LT TEST, is installed in each cockpit. Depressing the button in either cockpit will test the indicators and lights in both cockpits.</p>
