      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The following procedures provide an amplified listing which applies to the SR-71A/B aircraft.</p>
      <h2>Symbol Coding</h2>
      <ol class="list-number">
        <li>
          <p>Steps without special notations apply to the forward cockpit of all aircraft.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="applic-SR71A-aft">
          <p>Steps with an enclosed number apply to the aft cockpit of the SR-71A.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="applic-all-all">
          <p>Steps preceded by the ▲ symbol apply to both cockpits of all aircraft.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="applic-all-forward-SR71B-aft">
          <p>Steps preceded by a T apply to the forward cockpit of all aircraft as well as the aft cockpit of the SR-71B.</p>

        </li>
        <li class="applic-SR71B-aft">
          <p>Steps preceded by an enclosed T apply only to the aft cockpit of the SR-71B.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The same system is used for abbreviated checklists which are provided separately for the Pilot and RSO. Interior Preflight checklists are provided for each crew position. From Starting Engines on, checklists are common.</p>

    <section>
      <h1>Crew Coordination</h1>
      <p>Crew coordination is paramount to mission success and safety of flight. Communication between crewmembers should be continuous when accomplishing checklists. Verbal coordination between crewmembers is required prior to:</p>
      <ol class="list-alpha">
        <li>
          <p>Going off interphone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Going off aircraft oxygen system or opening faceplate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Changing the programmed mission or steering reference points, changing the pilot's ANS distance display mode (DP/TURN), or changing navigational system mode.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Changing the attitude reference.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The pilot pressing the indicator and warning lights test button.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Autopilot engagement or disengagement (including KEAS HOLD, MACH HOLD, and AUTO NAV).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Change of fuel panel settings or fuel crossfeed or transfer operation.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The RSO must monitor aircraft attitude, altitude, and airspeed and advise the pilot if a potentially dangerous situation exists. This is particularly important during critical phases of flight involving substantial changes in aircraft attitude, altitude, and speed.</p>
      <p>It may be advantageous to use the interphone system HOT MIC feature for crew communication during some flight phases.</p>

      <h2>ROTATION TECHNIQUE</h2>
      <p>In general, the tires are more vulnerable to blowouts during takeoff than at landing because of the higher groundspeeds and gross weights involved. Wing lift quickly relieves the gear load as the nose is raised. Apply smooth, constant back pressure 15 to 25 knots below computed rotation speed. Lift the nosewheel off at rotation speed, using the rotation rate required to leave the ground at computed takeoff speed. Depending on gross weight, normal takeoff attitude is 8° to 10° nose high indication on the ADI. The transition from start of rotation to takeoff requires approximately 5 seconds when using the normal takeoff technique. Refer to Takeoff Speed Schedule in Part II of the Appendix for rotation and takeoff speeds.</p>

      <p>Premature nosewheel liftoff should be avoided because the unnecessary drag extends the ground run and may result in excessive tire loads.</p>

      </div>
      <h2>CROSSWIND TAKEOFF</h2>
      <p>The aircraft weathervanes into the wind during crosswind takeoffs when the nosewheel lifts off and nosewheel steering is no longer available. Rudder pressure must be held to counteract the crosswind. A definite correction must be made as the aircraft breaks ground. Apply lateral control as necessary for wings-level flight. Both the directional and lateral control applications are normal and no problems should be encountered when taking off during reasonable crosswind conditions.</p>

      <h2>Acceleration</h2>
      <p>The TDI is the primary speed and altitude reference for acceleration to, during, and for deceleration from supersonic flight. The pilot should crosscheck TDI indications with the pitot-static instruments. The RSO should monitor altitude, attitude, and speed. Crosscheck navigation system ground speed against aircraft speed indications.</p>
      <h2>SUPERSONIC AIRSPEED SCHEDULES</h2>
      <p>The optimum supersonic airspeed is 450 KEAS while climbing between Mach 1.25 and Mach 2.6. Lower airspeeds such as 400 or 375 KEAS may be used, as when turbulence is encountered, but performance is considerably degraded.</p>

      </figure>
      <h2>TRANSONIC ACCELERATION PROCEDURE</h2>
      <p>Transonic acceleration is accomplished at either a level altitude or during a climb-and-descent maneuver.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>The climb-and-descent acceleration is recommended for best specific range (NM per pound of fuel used).</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Level Acceleration</h2>
      <p>A level acceleration to intercept the supersonic climb speed schedule can be made at refueling altitude, normally 25,000 feet. When ambient temperatures are near or lower than standard, less time and distance are required to intercept the climb speed schedule than the climb-and-descent procedure. The total range penalty is small under these conditions.</p>
      <p>Start the acceleration with minimum afterburner. Complete course changes while subsonic so that the additional power required for turning will not diminish the power available for transonic acceleration. Set maximum power at Mach 0.9. Gently increase pitch to climb attitude near 430 KEAS. A smooth technique is required, as 450 KEAS is only slightly more than Mach 1.1 at 25,000 feet and is still within the critical thrust/drag speed range which begins near Mach 1.05.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p>
          <span>Airspeed may increase rapidly after Mach 1.1 is reached.</span>
          <u>Reduce power</u>
          <span>(below Military, if necessary) to avoid high airspeeds. Do not use excessive load factors to prevent exceeding 450 KEAS.</span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>The procedure can be used at another altitude; however, when lower, the transition to 450 KEAS climb attitude must be made in the unfavorable speed range from Mach 1.05 to 1.10. At higher altitudes, the transition through this speed range can be completed before starting the climb, but less thrust is available. If ambient temperature increases, thrust decreases and the time, fuel and distance penalty for using the level acceleration procedure is greater.</p>
      <h2>Climb-And-Descent Acceleration</h2>
      <p>The climb-and-descent procedure requires less fuel to intercept the climb speed schedule than the level acceleration when ambient temperatures are warmer than standard.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>The climb-and-descent procedure is recommended for best specific range (NM per pound of fuel used) at all temperatures.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="warning">
        <p>Although angle of attack increases during the subsonic climb, pitch attitude must decrease to avoid dangerous flight conditions. Failure to monitor and control attitude, speed, and angle of attack can result in approach to pitch-up conditions.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Start the acceleration with minimum afterburner power. Intercept 0.9 Mach. Set maximum afterburner at 30,000 feet for the remainder of the acceleration, observing the 300 KEAS restriction. At 33,000 feet, increase speed to at least Mach 0.95. This speed is slightly above the start of the drag rise region. Make a smooth transition to establish a 2500 to 3000 fpm rate of descent.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Engine stalls during the subsonic climb may indicate a potentially dangerous flight situation. Stalls can result from low CIP or high distortion in the inlet associated with aircraft operation beyond established flight limits. Refer to Subsonic Compressor Stalls, Section III.</p>
      </div>
      <p>After establishing the descent rate, maintain attitude until initiating climb. Avoid higher rates of descent since the usual result is altitude penetration below 29,000 feet and high fuel consumption.</p>
      <p>When using the climb-and-descent procedure, it is important to exceed Mach 1.05 early in the descent, and to avoid turning until the climb is established. Begin the transition to climb near 435 KEAS so as to intercept 450 KEAS while climbing.</p>

      <p>Cross-check the TDI altitude, KEAS, and Mach displays with IAS, indicated Mach, and altimeter, periodically, to detect discrepancies in the TDI. If Mach number appears to be inaccurate, make appropriate adjustments so that flight limits will not be exceeded.</p>
      <p>The checklist Mach-KEAS-Altitude Relationship chart and the Mach-Airspeed-Temperature Conversion chart can be used to check the TDI and ANS true airspeed. Indicated spike position vs. the TDI and indicated Mach provides another cross-check on Mach number, as spike position is based on DAFICS Mach output.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p>In the SR-71B, no warning is displayed if the SAS channel engage switches are not ON in the cockpit that does not have AFCS control. If the SAS engage switch(es) are OFF in the cockpit that does not have AFCS control, transferring AFCS control to that cockpit results in loss of SAS until the SAS switch(es) are engaged. Verbally confirm the position of the SAS channel engage switches before transferring AFCS control.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Flight will not be extended into night or IFR conditions if the pilot's standby attitude indicator and either the ANS or INS reference for the ADI are inoperative or erroneous. Climb and penetration through overcast is permitted. If already operating in night or IFR conditions, land when practical.</p>
      <h2>Pitot Static Reference - Subsonic Operation</h2>
      <p>
        <span>The pressure altimeter is the primary altitude reference for</span>
        <u>subsonic</u>
        <span>flight operation; to fly an assigned altitude, use the altimeter correction card.</span>
      </p>
      <p>IFF Mode C uses DAFICS (TDI) altitude for automatic altitude reporting.</p>
      <h2>Operation at Supersonic Speeds</h2>
      <p>Avoid sustained operation at speeds between Mach 2.5 and 2.7 when convenient. This area is normally more susceptible to inlet duct roughness than higher or lower speeds. Refer to Climb, Section VI.</p>
      <h2>Autopilot Operation, Cruise or Climb</h2>
      <p>Manual trim in the yaw and roll axes may be used while the roll autopilot is engaged in Heading Hold or Auto Nav modes to minimize track error (course hang-off). When only attitude-hold mode (pitch or roll autopilot) is engaged, use the trim wheel on the function selector panel to adjust attitude. (Manual trim inputs at this time will only cause control transients.) If Mach hold is desired, engage the pitch autopilot and stabilize the aircraft at the desired Mach before engaging the Mach hold mode.</p>
      <h2>Optimizing Trim</h2>
      <p>Trim should be optimized during cruise to minimize drag. With the autopilot on, match fuel flows then apply yaw trim as needed to center the turn-and-slip ball. The periscope may be used to visually confirm rudder trim symmetry. With the roll autopilot engaged, check for off-center displacement of the roll autopilot alignment needle. "Beep" roll trim in the direction of needle displacement until the needle is centered. It may be necessary to repeat the procedure if KEAS or Mach changes.</p>
      <p>The max range loss factors for rudder, sideslip, or c.g. deviation (based on symmetrical power and supersonic cruise) are:</p>
      <p>rudder: 1° - 3 nm 2° - 12 nm</p>
      <p>sideslip: 1° - 12 nm 2° - 48 nm</p>
      <p>c.g.: 50 nm/% c.g. fwd of 25% MAC</p>
      <h2>Turning, in Auto Nav Mode</h2>
      <p>While in the Auto Nav mode, anticipate turn entry. Use manual stick inputs, if necessary, to avoid excessive roll rates and bank angles. It is unlikely that the stick shaker warning will be encountered during the roll-in to a normal turn. If shaker warning occurs while rolling into a steep turn, manually reduce the roll rate.</p>
      <h2>Steep Turns</h2>
      <p>
        <span>The pitch autopilot can be used for turns with bank angles up to 45.</span>
        <u>Pitch and roll</u>
        <span>attitude must be monitored when making steep turns.</span>
      </p>
      <h2>C.G. Crosscheck</h2>
      <p>Since center of gravity control is important for optimum cruise performance and safety, crosscheck the c.g. indication with pitch trim and, occasionally, by computation.</p>
      <p>
        <span>During climb, the c.g. normally moves aft approximately</span>
        <span>1%</span>
        <span>per 5000 pounds of fuel used and can be expected to reach 24% to 25% when the fuel in tank 1 reaches the right-hand shutoff setting. This should occur near the level-off point in a</span>
        <u>supersonic</u>
        <span>flight profile after air refueling to full tanks. After right-hand shutoff, the automatic sequencing provides a center of gravity which will approach 25%. This minimizes elevon deflection and trim drag during</span>
        <u>supersonic</u>
        <span>operation. If c.g. should exceed 25%, transfer fuel forward (C.G. annunciator panel warning light illuminates when c.g. reaches 25.3 to 25.6%). During</span>
        <u>subsonic</u>
        <span>mission legs, successive forward transfers may be necessary to keep the c.g. forward of the subsonic aft limit (22%).</span>
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <span>The optimum</span>
          <u>supersonic</u>
          <span>c.g. position may not be reached automatically with a partial fuel load. Manual fuel management may be required.</span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Fuel Management</h2>
      <p>Maintain c.g. forward of the center of gravity limit by using forward transfer. Forward transfer should also be used for an electrical system or SAS emergency.</p>
      <p>Select fuel crossfeed OPEN any time tanks 5 and 6 are empty with both engines operating normally, and any time the FUEL QTY LOW caution light or an L or R FUEL PRESS warning light illuminates. Even though symmetrical thrust conditions exist, the use of crossfeed during afterburner operation can result in mismatched fuel flow indications of as much as 7000 lb per hour, due to fuel crossflow through the fuel heat sink system.</p>
      <p>With crossfeed closed, should fuel flows to the engines be mismatched, c.g. may move out of the desired range. If the right fuel flow is higher, c.g. will not move aft as fast as the normal schedule and if the left fuel flow is higher, the converse is true. If fuel flows are mismatched, c.g. should be closely monitored as the full capabilities of the transfer system may be needed to obtain optimum c.g.</p>
      <p>Manual aft transfer is provided to augment the automatic aft transfer system. Manual aft transfer is only effective if tank 5 is less than full.</p>
      <p>
        <span>The following three methods are designed to move the c.g. aft. Early manual fuel management is especially important with a less-than-full fuel load during supersonic acceleration. Manual aft transfer has a lower rate of c.g. movement than</span>
        <u>Method a</u>
        <span>only, being equal to 71% of</span>
        <u>Method a</u>
        <span>rate.</span>
      </p>
      <h2>Method a</h2>
      <p>Press tank 1 on to override the RHSO until the fuel level in tank 1 reaches 3000 pounds.</p>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>Do not manually select tank 1 with less than 3000 pounds remaining in that tank. The forward pumps would be operating without fuel cooling and lubrication.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Method b</h2>
      <p>Pressing tank 2 on and opening the crossfeed valve is effective until tank 3 is empty. The rate of c.g. movement of this method will vary depending on the amounts of fuel remaining in tanks 1 and 2.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Using this method eliminates automatic aft transfer. Increased aft c.g. movement can be obtained by depressing the manual aft transfer switch once tank 5 starts to operate.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Method c</h2>
      <p>Depressing the manual aft transfer switch is the primary means for moving the c.g. aft when tank 2 and 5 are supplying fuel during normal fuel sequencing.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <span>With the crossfeed valve open and only</span>
          <u>one</u>
          <span>forward tank supplying fuel, the c.g. may move forward.</span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Engine Operation</h2>
      <p>Exhaust gas temperature and engine speed limits vary with compressor inlet temperature. Refer to Engine Operating Limits, Section V. When encountered, slow fluctuations in EGT, fuel flow and rpm should be reported for maintenance evaluation; however, fluctuations of ± 1% are expected and are not detrimental to engine operation. Random fluctuations of ±4% are expected in nozzle position indication and are not detrimental to engine operation.</p>

      <h2>Effect of Engine Thrust Variation with EGT</h2>
      <p>For a given level of thrust, higher throttle settings and increased fuel flow are required as EGT is decreased, because combined burning efficiency of the engine and AB decreases with lowered EGT. Full throttle ceilings are therefore reduced. The degradation in thrust for all throttle settings, at Mach 3.2 and 80,000 feet, is approximately 1.3 percent per 10°C of EGT decrease. The trend is the same for other flight conditions.</p>
      <h2>Effect of RPM Suppression on Maximum Thrust</h2>
      <p>As EGT decreases, the engine nozzle opens to maintain scheduled rpm. At high Mach and maximum power, the nozzle may open fully and any EGT decrease will result in rpm suppression below schedule. When this occurs, engine speed will suppress approximately 50 rpm for each 10°C of EGT decrease. The airflow through the engine decreases due to the suppressed rpm, leading to a higher inlet bypass requirement and opening of the forward bypass doors. At Mach 3.2 this results in a thrust degradation and drag increase of approximately 3.5 percent per 10°C of EGT decrease for each engine. If Mach number decreases as a result of the change in thrust and drag, the spikes schedule more forward and the forward bypass doors open further. Performance will deteriorate rapidly under these cumulative effects. Cruise EGT should be maintained between 775°C and 805°C to avoid this situation.</p>
      <h2>Crew Comfort</h2>
      <p>Pressure suit ventilation air temperature tends to increase and flow decreases while approaching the end of long cruise periods at maximum speed. The increase in temperature is associated with increasing fuel manifold temperature as tank 3 empties and the quantity remaining is exposed to high skin temperatures. This results in less cooling of the engine bleed air as it passes through the fuel-air heat exhangers in the environmental control system. Comfortable suit vent temperatures are restored as soon as tank 2 is scheduled on.</p>
      <p>If uncomfortably warm suit vent temperatures are encountered, insure that the suit heat rheostat in the forward cockpit is OFF. Each crewmember can open his air controller valve to increase flow through the suits. If this is not sufficient, the pilot can manually select the tank 2 boost pumps on if the condition can be associated with depletion of tank 3. The c.g. indication must be monitored and kept within limits. Premature use of tank 4 is not recommended as an alternate to using tank 2 fuel.</p>

      <h2>Pilot Director Lights (On Tanker)</h2>
      <p>For the KC-135, refer to Figures 2-12 and 2-13. Receiver director lights are located on the bottom of the tanker fuselage between the nose gear and the main gear. They consist of two rows of lights, the left row for elevation and the right row for boom telescoping.</p>
      <p>The elevation lights consist of five colored panels with green strips, green triangles, and red triangles to indicate relative position. Two illuminated letters, D and U for down and up movement, respectively, indicate elevation corrections. Background lights are located behind the panels. The elevation lights are controlled by boom elevation during contact.</p>
      <p>KC-10 pilot director lights, Figure 2-14, are similar to the KC-135 director lights. The KC-10 elevation director lights consist of a green square, amber triangles, red triangles, and amber D and U letters. The lights are controlled by boom elevation plus boom elevation rate during contact.</p>
      <p>The colored panels which indicate KC-135 boom telescoping are not illuminated by background lights. An illuminated white panel between each colored panel serves as a reference. The letters A for aft and F for forward are visible at the ends of the boom telescoping panel. Figure 2-13 shows the panel illumination at various boom nozzle positions within the boom envelope. When contact is made, the lights are controlled by boom extension. There are no lights to indicate azimuth; however, a yellow line on the tanker indicates the centerline.</p>

      <p>The KC-10 lights which indicate boom telescoping are shown in Figure 2-14. When contact is made, the panels are controlled by boom extension plus extension rate.</p>
      <p>During radio silence, when in the ready condition, the boom operator actuates the red panels of the receiver director lights to direct the receiver pilot. Illumination of the triangular panels nearest the U and D letters directs the pilot to move up or down respectively. The rectangular panels nearest the F and A letters direct the pilot to move forward or aft respectively. A steady red light indicates that a relatively large correction is desired in the indicated direction. A flashing red light indicates that relatively small correction is necessary.</p>
      <h2>Fuel Management Prior to Refueling</h2>
      <p>Transfer fuel as necessary to maintain c.g. within the subsonic limits and manually energize the tank 4 fuel pumps. Reducing the quantity in tank 4 provides more space for cool fuel from the tanker to reduce the temperature of tank 4 fuel and prevents the ullage pumps from cycling due to fuel level fluctuations during refueling. Forward transfer provides a more desirable center of gravity for unaugmented pitch stability and also replenishes tank 1 so that its boost pumps will supply the left fuel manifold during refueling. Fuel is also supplied to the right manifold when tank 4 is below 3600 1200 pounds, or tank 1 is pressed on manually, or the tank 1 fuel level is above the right hand shutoff level. Forward transfer should be repeated if there is any appreciable delay before initial refueling contact or between subsequent refueling contacts. Do not transfer excessive amounts to tank 1, however, as cg forward of 17% reduces load factor limits. Forward transfer should be shut off before making contact.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Crossfeed should be used if the FUEL QTY LOW light illuminates or tanks 5 and 6 are empty.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Approach For Refueling</h2>
      <p>Make the approach from behind and below. Deicing is only provided on the left windshield panel. The seat should be lowered prior to reaching the observation position. Upon completion of the Before Refueling procedure, maneuver to the pre-contact position about 50 feet to the rear and 10 feet below the refueling position. Stabilize and trim the aircraft. Maneuver as indicated by director light signals or by verbal instructions of the boom operator.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <ul class="list-circle">
          <li>
            <p>COMNAV 50 range and bearing information may be lost when below the tanker if the tanker has not switched to lower antenna.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The air-to-air mode of the TACAN provides both range and bearing with all KC-10 and some KC-135Q aircraft, but range only with other KC-135Qs. TACAN information may be lost within one mile due to antenna blanking. TACAN signals are not resistant to meaconing, interference, and jamming.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h2>Refueling Hookup</h2>
      <p>A successful hookup is confirmed by steady illumination of the director light panel and extinguishing of the ready light. Hookup can be maintained between the aircraft and tanker during a turn or in a descent. No adverse flight characteristics result from tanker downwash. Clear away aft and down along the axis of the refueling boom after disconnect.</p>
      <h2>Boom Elevation Limits</h2>
      <p>The KC-135 boom upper elevation limit is 20 degrees and the lower elevation limit is 40 degrees. For the SR-71 receiver, refueling above 25 degrees (green triangle) is not recommended. Any illumination of the red "down" triangle is outside the recommended SR-71 receiver envelope.</p>
      <p>The upper disconnect limit of the KC-10 boom can be varied. Although the KC-10 can refuel between 20 degrees and 40 degrees, the upper limit for the SR-71 has been set at 23 degrees. With the 23 degree upper limit set, the director lights will show the center of the envelope at 31.5 degrees (Figure 2-14). During refueling, the KC-10 director lights are higher in the pilot's field of view than the KC-135 director lights. Below 36 degrees elevation, the SR-71 pilot may not be able to see the KC-10 director lights even with the seat full down.</p>

      <ol class="list-number">
        <li>
          <p>Automatically.</p>
          <ol class="list-alpha">
            <li>
              <p>If boom envelope limits are exceeded.</p>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Pressure disconnects do not usually occur with the KC-10 since the refueling system reduces flow to maintain normal refueling pressure.</p>
      <ol class="list-number" start="2">
        <li>
          <p>Manually.</p>
          <ol class="list-alpha">
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>By depressing the A/R DISC trigger on the control stick grip.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>By the KC-10 boom operator activating the Independent Disconnect System (IDS). The IDS retracts the KC-10 boom latch surface inward and frees the boom even with the SR-71 boom latches still extended.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>When pull on the boom becomes excessive ("tension" or "brute force" disconnect).</p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>The latch toggle hydraulic system incorporates a pressure relief valve which will permit the boom to be pulled out when a pullout force of approximately 5400 pounds is applied. Therefore, if a malfunction occurs which prevents disconnecting the boom, place the air refuel switch in the MAN O'RIDE position, depress the A/R DISC trigger switch, and proceed with brute-force pullout.</p>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>Disconnect in am aft and downward direction, and avoid forward relative motion during disconnect. Disconnect maneuvers which tend to pry the boom out of the receptacle will damage the receptacle or airframe.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Boom Control Failure (KC-10)</h2>
      <p>The KC-10 boom control system is a dual channel fly-by-wire system. If the two control channels disagree, the boom fails passive with controls in their last position.</p>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>If KC-10 boom control failure occurs, the receiver pilot should follow the boom operator's instructions. The boom operator will direct the receiver to a position that will allow a safe disconnect with the boom loaded slightly away from the receiver.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>NORMAL AIR REFUELING PROCEDURE</h2>
      <p>Refueling can be accomplished from either cockpit of the SR-71B.</p>
      <ol class="list-number">
        <li>
          <p>Center of gravity - Checked.</p>
          <p>Transfer fuel to maintain subsonic c.g.; the c.g. will tend to travel aft slightly during the initial portion of the refueling. After c.g. adjustment, the pitch trim should indicate at least 0 to 1° nose up. CG forward of 17% reduces load factor limits.</p>

      <h2>POWER LIMITED REFUELING</h2>
      <p>Engine EGT may be manually uptrimmed. Uptrimming should be done prior to establishing tanker contact, but is permissible during contact. If CIT is below 5°C, the nominal EGT schedule in Figure 2-4 decreases rapidly and compressor surge (stall) is possible if the schedule is exceeded. Downtrim immediately if EGT exceeds 830°C or if the engine stalls.</p>
      <p>If military power limit is reached prior to completion of fuel transfer, the receiver may request the tanker to initiate a "toboggan" maneuver, or may elect to use one afterburner. If afterburner is used, set one throttle in Minimum A/B. Left afterburner is recommended. A slightly downtrim med EGT on the afterburning engine helps minimize power asymmetry. Use the opposite throttle to vary thrust. For actual and simulated single engine air refueling procedures, see Section III, Single Engine Air Refueling.</p>
      <h2>BREAKAWAY PROCEDURE</h2>
      <p>Any tanker or receiver crewmember, if an emergency arises, will transmit on the air refueling frequency the tanker aircraft call sign followed by "breakaway, breakaway, breakaway." The boom operator may signal breakaway by rapidly flashing the receiver director lights. The receiver pilot will actuate the A/R DISC trigger. Retard throttles and drop aft and down until the entire tanker is in sight.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p>The pilot should use care not to overrun the tanker. If overrunning does occur, under no conditions should a turn be made until breakaway has been completed.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Breakaway Signal</h2>
      <p>To visually signal emergency breakaway, the tanker turns on the rotating beacon and rapidly flashes the director lights.</p>
      <h2>AIR REFUELING ALTERNATE PROCEDURE</h2>
      <p>If L hydraulic pressure is lost, R pressure may be utilized for refueling by moving the brake switch to ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE.</p>
      <p>Normal and manual boom latching air refueling procedures apply with ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE selected.</p>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>Do not leave the brake switch in ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE after refueling. R hydraulic pressure may be lost also if L system fluid loss is due to a malfunction of the steering or refueling system.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>MANUAL BOOM LATCHING</h2>
      <p>A manual refueling procedure may be used if the signal amplifier fails. This procedure requires manual control of the refueling boom latches. The refueling boom latches are open with the air refuel switch in MAN O'RIDE and the A/R DISC trigger on the control stick grip depressed. The receiver pilot can usually feel the boom nozzle bottom in the receptacle. The READY light will extinguish when the boom nozzle is properly seated; then the pilot should latch the boom in the receptacle by releasing the trigger switch. When latching the boom manually:</p>
      <ol class="list-number">
        <li>
          <p>Air refuel switch - MAN O'RIDE, READY light on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Trigger switch - Press and hold.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <span>After nozzle is seated in receptacle</span>
        <u>and</u>
        <span>READY light is</span>

        <li>
          <p>Trigger switch - Release.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>When refueling is completed:</p>
      <ol class="list-number" start="4">
        <li>
          <p>Trigger switch - Press and hold until boom is clear.</p>
          <p>READY light illuminates when boom is not seated. DISC light will not illuminate.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Subsequent procedures are the same as after normal refueling.</p>
      <div class="caution">
        <ul class="list-circle">
          <li>
            <p>If the A/R DISC trigger switch is released when the nozzle is not in the bottom of the receptacle (READY light is off), it is possible for the nozzle to damage or break the extended nozzle latches, preventing any further refueling.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The boom limit switches are deactivated when using manual boom latching. The receiver pilot must initiate disconnect before exceeding the boom limits since the boom operator will be unable to release the nozzle latches. KC-10 boom operators can still use the Independent Disconnect System.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p>There will not be a pressure disconnect when using manual boom latching, but the refuel manifold accepts tanker pressure with ample margin after tanks shut off automatically. The fuel vent manifold releases excess tank pressure if the tank shutoff valves malfunction.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Radio Silence Refueling Procedure</h3>
      <p>Radio silence air refueling can be conducted if the following procedures are observed and both crews are experienced in normal air refueling procedures. The method, time, and place of rendezvous, and amount of fuel to be transferred, must be coordinated.</p>
      <ol class="list-alpha">
        <li>
          <p>Air refueling checks will be completed before moving to the precontact position.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Before contact, maneuver as directed by tanker director lights. A steady red light indicates a large correction and a flashing red light indicates a small correction in the direction indicated by the red director lights. When contact is made, boom interphone may be used.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Air Refueling Visual Signals</h3>
      <p>The following visual signals will be used for radio communication failure or radio silence.</p>
      <h2>Signals From Tanker</h2>
      <p>With boom in trail:</p>
      <ol class="list-alpha">
        <li>
          <p>Ten foot extension of the probe means that the tanker is ready for contact.</p>
          <p>When the ready signal is received, move from the observation position and stabilize in the precontact position, then move to the contact position.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Full extension of the probe means that the tanker is ready for contact but that he is in manual control, without disconnect control capability.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Close and open the Air Refueling door to acknowledge this signal.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Boom interphone is inoperative when the tanker is in manual operation.</p>
      </div>
      <ol class="list-alpha" start="3">
        <li>
          <p>Full retraction of the boom indicates that offload has been completed.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Boom stowed:</p>
      <ol class="list-alpha">
        <li>
          <p>Full retraction of the probe means that the tanker air refueling system is inoperative.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Five foot extension of the probe indicates that there is an air refueling system malfunction.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Check the air refueling system.</p>
      <p>Director lights off:</p>
      <p>A request to disconnect is signalled by turning the director lights off. Return to the precontact position after disconnecting.</p>
      <p>Director lights flashing:</p>
      <p>The BREAKAWAY command is signalled by turning the lower rotating beacon on and rapid flashing of the director lights.</p>
      <h2>Signal From Receiver</h2>
      <p>Cycle the Air Refueling Door:</p>
      <p>Cycling the A/R door while in the precontact position indicates that the Manual Boom Latching procedure will be used. The tanker should signal acknowledgement by full extension of the refueling probe with the boom in trail, and then retract the probe to the ready position.</p>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>During manual boom latching, the receiver pilot must initiate all disconnects. KC-10 boom operators can still use the Independent Disconnect System.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Rock wings (daytime) and turn rotating beacon on/off at ten second intervals:</p>
      <p>This signal indicates that the receiver must refuel. If not at a scheduled time or place for refueling (when the boom operator might not be in place) take a position where the signals are visible from the tanker cockpit.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Fuel Dumping</h2>
      <p>Fuel dumping provides a means of reducing gross weight rapidly. The nominal dump rate is 2500 pounds per minute for both FUEL DUMP and EMER switch positions, but the rate varies with the amount of fuel remaining and the number of boost pumps operating.</p>
      <p>Normally, fuel is dumped in the automatic fuel sequence. An additional tank can be selected in each tank group to increase the dump rate.</p>
      <p>To dump fuel:</p>
      <ol class="list-number">
        <li>
          <p>Fuel dump switch - FUEL DUMP.</p>
          <p>All tanks containing fuel will empty in the normal usage sequence except tank 1. Tank 1 will dump automatically with the other tanks until its fuel level reaches approximately 4700 pounds, depending on aircraft attitude (see Fig. 1-36), then it will stop. The other tanks will continue dumping until the fuel level in tank 4 reaches 3700 pounds (again depending on aircraft attitude), then normal dumping is terminated automatically regardless of the fuel quantities remaining in the other tanks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>C.G. - Monitor.</p>
          <p>Transfer fuel as necessary to maintain c.g. within limits. At heavy weight, with more than 40,000 pounds of fuel remaining, consider pressing tank 2 on manually to avoid any abnormal forward c.g. condition during dumping. Crossfeed can also be used and will tend to shift c.g. aft.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fuel quantity - Monitor total and tank 4.</p>
          <ol class="list-alpha">

            <li>
              <p>All dumping should terminate automatically when 3700 pounds remain in tank 4.</p>

      <h2>Normal Landing</h2>
      <p>Touchdown is made with the throttles in IDLE, and at approximately 9.5 degrees angle of attack. (Due to ground effect, angle of attack is nearly the same as for final approach.) Pitch angle is approximately 10.5 degrees, with the nose almost on the horizon. A high rate of sink will develop if airspeed becomes excessively low on final approach, and result in a hard landing.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <ul class="list-circle">
          <li>
            <p>Throttle movement should follow the quadrant curvature so that the hidden ledge at the IDLE position can prevent inadvertent engine cutoff.</p>

            <p>With cockpit air on, sudden fogging can occur when the throttles are retarded during the landing flare. Use the Cockpit Fog emergency procedure in this event.</p>
          </li>
          <li>

          <p>Nosewheel steering - Engage.</p>

          <p>Illumination of the nose wheel steering STEER ON light is a positive indication that steering has engaged.</p>
          <p>It may be necessary to move the rudder pedals through a small range on each side of neutral to assure alignment with the nose wheel castering angle. In a crosswind, engagement will probably require momentarily moving the pedals in a direction opposite to that desired for steering.</p>
          <p>Although the steering system includes a holding relay in the engagement circuit, the recommended method for positive engagement is to hold the nosewheel steering (CSC/NWS) button on the control stick depressed until steering is engaged. The button may be released after engagement.</p>
          <p>Nose wheel steering is released by pressing and releasing the button a second time (whether actually engaged or not). If steering is inadvertently released, depress the button again and reengage steering as before.</p>

          <p>The normal performance procedure should be used on a dry runway or on a grooved runway with braking equivalent to a dry runway. (Refer to Wet/Slippery Runway Landings, this section, if landing on a runway where braking may be degraded). Apply brakes as required. Light braking is sufficient if the drag chute deploys normally.

      <h2>CROSSWIND LANDING</h2>
      <p>Refer to Landing Gear System, Crosswind Limits in Section V. Also refer to the Crosswind Component chart in the Appendix, Figure A2-1.</p>
      <p>Runway alignment on final approach can be maintained by crabbing and/or dropping one wing. Remove any crab before touchdown, and use the wing-low technique to align the aircraft with the runway and prevent side drift.</p>
      <p>Reduce sink rate to a minimum to accomplish a smooth touchdown. As crosswind components increase, sink rate must be minimized due to the increased side loads imposed on the landing gear.</p>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>It is essential to remove all crab before touchdown to minimize scuffing damage to the tires.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Crosswind Condition With Dry or Grooved Runway</h2>
      <p>Touchdown and try to remain on the upwind side of the runway. This provides more runway space on the downwind side, and puts the crosswind and runway "crown" effects in opposition. Deploy the drag chute early in the landing roll, as for a normal landing, but lower the nosewheel first and engage steering if the crosswind component is over 15 knots.</p>
      <p>The chute's tendency to pull the aircraft off the runway in a crosswind decreases as speed is reduced, and the effect is easily controllable with nosewheel steering. Keep the stick forward to improve nose wheel steering effectiveness. Increasing rudder deflection and/or increasing elevon differential is required as speed decreases.</p>
      <p>Do not shut down either engine when on a dry runway, or on a grooved runway which provides equivalent braking.</p>
      <h2>Crosswind Condition With Slippery Runway</h2>
      <p>For landing on a slippery runway with a crosswind, start the nose down immediately on landing and engage nosewheel steering before deploying the drag chute. After the nose is lowered, use lateral stick deflection and/or rudders to increase directional control. Use roll inputs in the same direction as rudder/nosewheel steering. This also increases braking on that side when combined with neutral or aft stick.</p>
      <p>
        <span>With a slippery runway, shutdown of one engine to assist in stopping is permissible if required due to drag chute failure. Shutdown the</span>
        <u>upwind</u>
        <span>engine when under 100</span>
        <u>KIAS</u>
        <span>, and select ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE if continuing on the right engine alone. Shutdown is not recommended if barrier engagement is available.</span>
      </p>
      <p>The nosewheel steering system provides adequate control in allowable crosswinds on slippery runways, even with damaged main gear tires. However, be careful not to overcontrol the aircraft and start a lateral skid. The nosewheel steering force can be very large and this force, combined with the reduced side reaction force capability of the main gear tires, may cause the main gear tires to "break away" and slide. The nosewheel steering force reaches a maximum at a 13-1/2 degree angle between the tires and the ground track. This corresponds to 6 degrees rudder deflection with the aircraft heading along the ground track.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Wet/slippery Runway Landings</h2>
      <p>When landing on a runway where degraded braking is expected (i.e., on a wet runway without grooves), select the WET anti-skid braking mode. When crosswind is not a factor, use the maximum performance touchdown speed schedule and lower the nose while deploying the drag chute. Apply maximum braking as soon as the nose wheel is on the runway and engage nosewheel steering. Frequent anti-skid cycling may be felt. Retain the drag chute if stopping distance is critical. The chute can be jettisoned if a control problem or a lateral skid develops.</p>
      <p>
        <span>If the drag chute fails to deploy, use moderate up-elevon to increase drag and the load on the main gear. The WET anti-skid mode provides the best braking capability with or without the drag chute unless tire failure has occurred; in this event, it may be necessary to complete the stop with anti-skid OFF and the wheels locked. Refer to Flat Tire Landing emergency procedure, Section III If the chute fails, shutdown of one engine is permissible when under 100</span>
        <u>KIAS</u>
        <span>if required to assist in stopping, but shutdown is not recommended if barrier engagement is available.</span>
      </p>
      <h2>Icy Runway Procedure</h2>
      <p>Use the same techniques as for the Wet/Slippery Runway landing.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Maximum Performance Landing</h2>
      <p>Use the maximum performance schedule whenever minimum landing distance is desirable. Maximum performance touchdown speed is 10 KIAS less than normal touchdown speed. Start drag chute deployment as soon as the main gear is on the runway and angle of attack is 10 degrees or less.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p>Do not deploy the chute in flight.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>Deploying the drag chute at greater than 10 degrees angle of attack may result in the canopy contacting the runway and receiving scuff damage.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Lower the nose and apply maximum braking as soon as the nose wheel is on the runway. Engage nosewheel steering. Retain the drag chute. One engine may be shutdown after touchdown to reduce thrust and shorten the landing roll.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p>Do not shutdown both engines, as it may result in the loss of brakes. Nosewheel steering will be lost when engine speed decays.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>MINIMUM ROLL</h2>
      <p>Reduce fuel weight to 5000 pounds, if possible, and use the maximum performance landing procedure.</p>
      <h2>HEAVYWEIGHT LANDING</h2>
      <p>Landings with more than 40,000 pounds of fuel remaining should be avoided, but can be accomplished if necessary. Use normal final approach speeds, but do not exceed 11 degrees angle of attack. Use the maximum performance touchdown speed schedule and observe touchdown rate of sink limits from Section V. When touchdown speed is less than the chute deploy limit speed (210 KIAS), lower the nose and deploy the drag chute as soon as the main gear is on the runway. If touchdown speed is higher than 210 KIAS, hold the nose off until 210 KIAS is reached, then lower the nose and deploy the drag chute. To minimize the possibility of tire failure at heavy weight, the brakes should be applied early in the landing roll. This reduces the distance travelled at high speed. Retain the drag chute. Barrier engagement should be anticipated, since the brake energy rating may be exceeded. Refer to Figure 5-9, Section V.</p>

      <h2>Go-around</h2>
      <p>A go-around may be initiated at any time during the approach or landing roll when sufficient runway remains for takeoff and no attempt to deploy the drag chute has been made. (See Figure 2-18.) For go-around after touchdown, reduce pitch attitude to approximately 5 degrees pitch angle (5 degrees above what the attitude would be with the nose on the ground) then adjust attitude to takeoff at 210 KIAS.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Touch-and-go Landing</h2>
      <p>Normal Before Landing and After Takeoff procedures apply to touch-and-go operations. The maximum fuel load recommended is 25,000 pounds remaining and cg aft of 17%. The limit sink rate is 8.7 fps (522 fpm) with 25,000 pounds of fuel.</p>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>Do not extend the landing gear more than 10 times each flight.</p>
      </div>
      <p>At least ten complete retract and extend cycles of the gear can be made with normal hydraulic quantity and reservoir nitrogen pressure servicing. If reservoir nitrogen pressure is depleted, cycling the landing gear may cavitate the L hydraulic system pump and cause complete loss of L hydraulic system pressure.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Manual EGT trim may be used when making successive low approaches or touch and go landings. This prevents auto EGT up-trim "ratcheting" which could occur because of power manipulation during approach, and which might result in EGT overtemperature while at or above Military power during go-around.</p>

        <h2>Quick Launch Start</h2>
        <p>While subject to Quick Launch, ensure that nobody has access to the aircraft unless authorized by the aircrew.</p>
        <p>If Quick Launch Setup procedures were not completed prior to start or if the aircraft is removed from Quick Launch status, use normal procedures for launch.</p>
        <p>When routine aircraft servicing is required, cockpit access requires crew authorization and the crew should accompany maintenance personnel (to remain aware of aircraft status and confirm that cockpit setup is not changed).</p>
        <p>Quick Launch Setup and Quick Launch Start procedures require ANS Ground Hot Start and INS Stored Heading procedures. If the aircraft is moved after the ANS and INS are shutdown, these alignments are invalidated and normal procedures for ANS and INS alignment should be used.</p>
        <p>Survival Quick Launch procedures assume external power is available for start. If external power fails the engines can be started but engine instrument indications, except for rpm, will not be available until a generator is turned on. If the crew chief does not use a headset during start, the aircrew must coordinate the hand signals to be used prior to assuming Quick Launch status.</p>
