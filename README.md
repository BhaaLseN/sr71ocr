# SR-71 OCR
This is an [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) of the declassified SR-71 Blackbird Flight Manual.

## TODO List

- [ ] Cross-check the OCR against the original (again)
- [ ] Create cross-references for plain-text (mainly figures and other sections)
- [x] Turn Warnings/Cautions/Notes into actual markup
- [ ] Move figures closer to their usage (or at least the most appropriate sub/section)
  - [x] Section I
  - [x] Section IA
  - [x] Section II
  - [ ] Section III
  - [ ] Section IV
  - [ ] Section V
  - [ ] Section VI
  - [ ] Section VII
  - [x] Appendix
- [x] Split the large files into section
  - [ ] Split the large files into multiple files
- [ ] Vectorize, redraw or at least touch-up images
- [ ] Complete the manual:
