# SR-71 OCR
This is an [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) of the declassified SR-71 Blackbird Flight Manual.

For the original source see [www.sr-71.org](https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/manual/).

## TODO List
- [x] Spellcheck
- [ ] Cross-check the OCR against the original (again)
- [ ] Create cross-references for plain-text (mainly figures and other sections)
- [x] Turn Warnings/Cautions/Notes into actual markup
- [ ] Move figures closer to their usage (or at least the most appropriate sub/section)
  - [ ] Section I
  - [ ] Section IA
  - [ ] Section II
  - [ ] Section III
  - [ ] Section IV
  - [ ] Section V
  - [ ] Section VI
  - [ ] Section VII
  - [x] Appendix
- [x] Split the large files into section
  - [ ] Split the large files into multiple files
- [ ] Vectorize, redraw or at least touch-up images
- [ ] OCR the other manuals:
  - [ ] Functional Check Flight Procedures [SR-71-6CF-1](https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/sr-71-6cf-1/)
  - [ ] The YF-12A Utility Flight Manual [YF-12A-1](https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/yf-12a-1/)
  - [ ] Others if available/declassified (A-12, M-21/D-21)
- [ ] _maybe more_
