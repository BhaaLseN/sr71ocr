- [ ] Tag acronyms and abbreviations
- [ ] Use consistent spacing for units/values and symbols
- [x] Turn Warnings/Cautions/Notes into actual markup
- [x] Move figures closer to their usage (or at least the most appropriate sub/section)
  - [x] Section I
  - [x] Section IA
  - [x] Section II
  - [x] Section III
  - [x] Section IV
  - [x] Section V

  - [x] Appendix
- [x] Split the large files into section
