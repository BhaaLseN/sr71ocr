      <h1>Foreword</h1>
      <p>SCOPE. This manual contains the information necessary for safe and efficient operation of the SR-71A and the SR-71B aircraft. These instructions provide you with a general knowledge of the aircraft, its characteristics and specific normal and emergency operation procedures. Your prerequisite flying experience is recognized, and it is not considered necessary to discuss basic flight principles.</p>
      <p>SOUND JUDGMENT. Instructions in this manual provide the best operating instructions under most circumstances, but they are not a substitute for sound judgment. Multiple emergencies, adverse weather, terrain, etc. may require modification of the procedures.</p>
      <p>ARRANGEMENT. The manual is divided into eight nearly independent sections to simplify using it as a reference manual. Sections II, III and V must be thoroughly understood before attempting to fly the aircraft. Section I is subdivided into two parts. The first section provides information which is applicable to the basic SR-71 A aircraft. Section LA provides special descriptive information for the SR-71B trainer aircraft. The remaining sections provide important information for safe and efficient mission accomplishment.</p>
      <p>CHANGES. This manual will be revised by numbered changes to reflect information gained from tests and operational experience and to augment the data provided. Operational or safety of flight supplements indicated as -1S or -1SS respectively, will be issued when necessary and incorporated in the succeeding numbered change.</p>
      <p>CHECKLISTS. The Flight Manual contains only amplified checklists. Abbreviated checklists are issued separately. Line items in the Flight Manual and checklists are identical with respect to arrangement and item number.</p>
      <p>WARNINGS, CAUTIONS, AND NOTES. The following definitions apply to "Warnings", "Cautions", and "Notes" found throughout the manual.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p>Operating procedures, practices, etc., which may result in personal injury or loss of life if not correctly followed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="caution">
        <p>Operating procedures, practices, etc., which if not strictly observed may result in damage to or destruction of equipment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p>An operating procedure, condition, etc., which it is essential to highlight.</p>
      </div>
      <p>YOUR RESPONSIBILITY - TO LET US KNOW. Comments, corrections, and questions regarding this manual are welcome.
