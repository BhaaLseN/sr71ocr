    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The emergency procedures recommended in this section should be followed unless circumstances such as weather, fuel, or other reasons dictate otherwise. The safest region for continued operation is subsonic unless altitude or aircraft range is a factor.</p>
    <p>Checklists have been provided where specific corrective steps can be enumerated. A narrative format has been used where an analysis is necessary to determine the correct course of action. In some cases, where a decision-tree analysis is possible, the forms have been combined.</p>
    <h3>Multiple Emergencies</h3>
    <p>Procedures are based on the assumption that each crewmember understands normal systems operation. Procedures usually cover single emergencies. Crewmembers must recognize that single malfunctions often affect operation of other aircraft systems and may require actions beyond those contained in a specific emergency procedure.</p>
    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <p>Three basic assumptions are made which are not reiterated in each individual procedure. These are: (1) Aircraft control is paramount. (2) Circuit breakers associated with a malfunctioning system must be checked. (3) The other crewmember must be advised of any emergency situation.</p>
    <h3>Symbol Coding</h3>
    <p>Symbols used to identify crew responsibility are the same as normal procedures. These are:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>Steps without special notations apply to the forward cockpit of all aircraft.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-SR71A-aft">
        <p>Steps with an enclosed number apply to the aft cockpit of the SR-71A.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>Steps preceded by the ▲ symbol apply to both cockpits of all aircraft.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-all-forward-SR71B-aft">
        <p>Steps preceded by a T apply to the forward cockpit of all aircraft as well as the aft cockpit of the SR-71B.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-SR71AB-aft">
        <p>
          <span>Steps with an enclosed T</span>
          <u>and</u>
          <span>step number apply to the aft cockpit of SR-71A/B.</span>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-SR71B-aft">
        <p>Steps preceded by an enclosed T apply only to the aft cockpit of the SR-71B.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Definitions Of Landing Situations</h3>
    <p>The terms "land when practical" and "land as soon as possible" are not interchangeable.</p>
    <p>
      <u>Land when practical</u>
      <span>means land at home base or other suitable alternate, with air refueling as necessary.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Land as soon as possible</u>
      <span>means land at the nearest suitable facility.</span>
    </p>
    <h3>Use Of Checklists</h3>
    <p>
      <span>Critical emergency checklist steps appear in capital bold print. The</span>
      <u>actions</u>
      <span>required must be committed to memory. In an emergency, the crewmember(s) must be able to accomplish these steps immediately without reference to the abbreviated checklist. This prevents any delay which might aggravate the emergency. Other checklist steps should be accomplished using the challenge and response method when time and circumstance permit. The most important consideration is to maintain aircraft control. Where an emergency situation requires more than one procedure, a reference to the other procedure(s) is included.</span>

    <h1>Ground Operation</h1>
    <h1>Ground Emergency Egress</h1>
    <p>In an emergency requiring ground abandonment, the primary concern is to leave the immediate area of the aircraft as soon as possible. The following procedure provides the fastest means of escape. The lap belt should not be released until the aircraft has stopped.</p>
    <h4>Aircraft On Fire</h4>
    <p>When the aircraft or the surrounding area is engulfed in flames, the crew may abandon the aircraft (relying on the faceplate, helmet, and suit for protection) or eject.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Do not eject unless the canopy is either closed or jettisoned clear of the aircraft.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Ground Emergency Egress Procedure</h3>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>Canopy Open Or Jettison.</p>
        <p>Open or jettison the canopies first unless fire danger exists. Retain the canopies until all preparations for evacuation are completed if there is danger of fire engulfing the cockpit area.</p>
        <p>The recommended order for canopy jettison is pilot, then RSO, so that the pilot's canopy cannot fall upon an open RSO cockpit and strike the RSO.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>SCRAMBLE HANDLE.</p>
        <p>Pull the scramble handle after the aircraft has stopped. This releases:</p>
        <ol class="list-parnumber">
          <li>
            <p>Lap belt. (The belt remains attached to the parachute.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Inertia reel shoulder harness.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Foot retention cables.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Parachute arming lanyard and housing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cable on ejection D-ring.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">
          <p>When pulling the scramble handle, expect a loud report from the initiator firing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="warning">
          <p>If the scramble handle does not function normally, the ejection seat safety pin should be installed to prevent inadvertent ejection. Then the harness, spurs, and lap belt must be released manually as required.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>Kit Handle.</p>
        <p>Pull the survival kit handle. This releases the kit from the torso harness, disconnects personal leads to the normal and emergency oxygen supplies, and releases the parachute from the survival kit lid. It also detaches the kit lanyard from the torso harness if the kit is seated firmly.</p>
        <p>The kit can also be released manually by pressing the quick release latches below each hip. The right latch also releases the kit lanyard.</p>
        <div class="warning">
          <ul class="list-circle">
            <li>
              <p>The crewmember must remain seated until the survival kit handle is pulled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The crewmember is still attached to the survival kit by the oxygen hose when using the quick release latches instead of the kit handle to disconnect from the kit.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>Chute Release.</p>
        <p>Open the parachute quick disconnects at the shoulder and lap, and lift the shoulder straps from the suit velcro patches.</p>
        <p>Egress with the chute is possible if it cannot be released.</p>
        <div class="warning">
          <p>Mobility with the chute is limited.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Standing up separates the helmet electrical connections and the suit vent hose.</p>
    <h1>Engine Fire</h1>
    <p>If a fire is evident during start, or on notification:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>THROTTLES OFF.</b>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>FUEL OFF.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Set both guarded EMER FUEL SHUTOFF switches to the fuel off position (up). Ac and dc power are required. During engine start, the ground crew should continue turning the engine if the fire is contained in the tailpipe. If the starter unit has disengaged, it cannot be reengaged until the engine has come to a complete stop.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Battery - OFF.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>Abandon the aircraft.</p>
        <div class="caution">
          <p>Without ground power, simultaneous shutdown of both engines may result in generator cut-out and loss of AC power before the emergency fuel shutoff valves can completely shut off the engine fuel supply. Similarly, actuating the battery switch within 5 seconds of closing the emergency fuel shutoff switches may result in incomplete valve operation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="caution">
          <p>If ground power is not connected, as during taxiing or after landing, and if crew safety is not an immediate factor, shut down the affected engine first followed by the affected engine fuel shutoff switch. To assure complete fuel shut-off to that side, allow 5 seconds before shutting down the second engine and actuating the battery switch.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Brake Or Steering Failure</h1>
    <p>Illumination of the ANTI-SKID OUT caution light may indicate brake failure.</p>
    <h3>Brake Or Steering Failure Procedure</h3>
    <p>If normal brakes and/or nose wheel steering are not effective, or if L hydraulic pressure is not available:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE</b>
        </p>
        <p>The green nosewheel steering engaged (STEER ON) light extinguishes if steering disengages due to loss of hydraulic pressure. Release brake pedal pressure, then move the brake switch to ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE.</p>
        <p>In ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE, the power source for braking is the R hydraulic system; nose wheel steering is powered by the L system until L system pressure decreases below 2200 psi, then steering shifts to the R hydraulic system automatically.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>If both engines are shutdown while the aircraft is moving, the brake switch should be set to OFF and steady pressure applied in one application until completely stopped; otherwise, antiskid cycling or pumping the brakes depletes the hydraulic system accumulator and results in loss of brakes. The L hydraulic system accumulator may provide up to 3 brake applications; however, the brake accumulator is not required to hold a charge.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If the antiskid system relieves brake pressure and wheel rpm does not increase within 2.7 seconds: the antiskid fail-safe circuit should deactivate antiskid and illuminate the ANTI SKID OUT annunciator caution light; and braking without antiskid protection should become available.</p>
        <ol class="list-alpha">
          <li class="applic-SR71B-aft">
            <p>Brake switch - OFF.</p>
            <p>Selection of OFF electrically disengages the aft cockpit switch from the brake system. Selection of ANTI SKID ON or ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE overrides the forward cockpit brake switch setting.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If alternate brakes are ineffective:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="2">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>ANTISKID OFF.</b>
        </p>
        <p>If the brake switch is placed to OFF: the L hydraulic system powers braking and steering, antiskid is disabled, and the ANTI-SKID OUT annunciator caution light illuminates.</p>
        <p>After S/B R-2695, holding the trigger switch depressed will disable antiskid and illuminate the ANTI-SKID OUT annunciator caution light. The hydraulic power source for brakes remains as selected by the brake switch. If R hydraulic pressure is not available, move the brake switch out of ALT STEER &amp; BRAKE.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Antiskid Out</h3>
    <p>The ANTI-SKID OUT caution light illuminates while on the ground if: the brake switch is in OFF; the antiskid system is disabled or fails; or, after S/B R-2695, the trigger switch is held depressed.</p>
    <p>With the ANTI-SKID OUT light on unaccountably:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">

        <p>Brake switch - OFF.</p>
        <p>Without antiskid operating, extreme caution must be used while braking to prevent wheel skid. Skidding is hard to detect due to aircraft size and weight. Tires may fail before a skid can be recognized and corrected. A main landing gear tire blowout may be sensed as a thump or muffled explosive sound.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Tire Failure</h1>
    <p>At takeoff weights, to decrease the probability of further tire failures, taxi distance should be minimized if one or two tires per main gear are flat. Taxiing is permitted to clear a runway with all tires failed on a main gear, as the massive tire bead protects the wheels for some distance. At normal landing weight, the aircraft can be taxied if one tire per main gear remains inflated.</p>

    <h1>Takeoff Emergencies</h1>
    <p>These procedures apply from the start of takeoff until the initial climb schedule is established.</p>
    <h1>Propulsion System</h1>
    <p>The propulsion system includes the main engines, afterburners, inlets, nozzles, tailpipes, fuel controls, and fuel-hydraulic, lubrication, and ignition systems. If abnormal operation of any of these components is indicated prior to reaching the acceleration check distance, the takeoff should be aborted. Refer to Abort procedure, this section.</p>
    <h3>Engine Failure</h3>

    <h3>Afterburner Failure During Takeoff</h3>
    <p>Abort if an afterburner fails prior to reaching the acceleration check speed. Refer to the Abort Procedure, this section.</p>
    <p>If an afterburner fails after reaching the acceleration check speed, confirm that both throttles are at the maximum afterburner position and continue the takeoff. Check EGT and for derichment. When safely airborne, positively identify the affected engine and then retard that throttle below the afterburner range. Pause at Military if the nozzle position indication is near closed, then check nozzle operation by retarding the throttle until the nozzle starts to open. A relight may be attempted if engine instrument indications and observation of the nacelle with the periscope disclose normal conditions; however, a malfunction should be assumed. Land when practical.</p>
    <h3>Afterburner Nozzle Failure</h3>
    <p>Nozzle failure is indicated when nozzle position and engine rpm response to throttle positioning are not normal. Engine shutdown may be necessary.</p>
    <p>If a nozzle fails open and takeoff is continued, keep the throttle in maximum afterburner until a reduction in thrust is possible. Anticipate engine overspeed when the throttle is retarded and be prepared to reduce throttle position below Military.</p>
    <p>If a nozzle fails toward closed, expect EGT rise, rpm suppression, compressor stall, and possible engine flameout.</p>
    <p>Use the Afterburner Nozzle Failure procedures under In-Flight Emergency Procedures, this section, and land as soon as possible.</p>
    <h1>Fire</h1>
    <p>Abort if either fire warning light illuminates before refusal speed. Above refusal speed, use the Engine Fire/Engine Shutdown procedure, this section, and land as soon as possible.</p>
    <h1>Abort</h1>
    <p>The abort procedure assumes that a decision to abort is made before rotation speed. Aborts from above rotation speed are not prohibited, but the risks associated with aborting from such a high initial speed at takeoff weight must be balanced against the risks of continuing a takeoff. In general, after rotation speed, the best course of action is to continue rather than abort, unless the aircraft cannot fly.</p>
    <h2>Engine Management</h2>
    <p>Both throttles should he retarded to IDLE and the brakes applied with the nose down as soon as the decision to abort is made. The planned rotation speed may be exceeded; however, the nose wheel should be kept on the runway to take advantage of nosewheel steering.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>For chute failure, shutdown the right engine after both are idling, or complete the shutdown of a failed or flamed out engine. This reduction in thrust decreases stopping distance, and reduces the possibility of tire failure.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Wait until rpm and EGT show that both engines are idling (or that one engine is failing) before selecting the engine to shutdown. Loss of both engines will result in loss of hydraulic pressure for steering, and braking may not be possible.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Aircraft Attitude, With Decision to Abort</h2>
    <p>Lower the nose and start braking at nosewheel contact. When rotation is well advanced, the aircraft may accelerate beyond takeoff speed and lift off before rotation can be checked. In this case, hold the aircraft off sufficiently to regain control and then touchdown without sideslip, near the center of the runway if possible.</p>
    <h2>Chute Deployment</h2>
    <p>The drag chute requires 4 to 5 seconds for deployment after drag chute control actuation. If above 210 KIAS, it is permissible to actuate the DRAG CHUTE T-handle while decelerating in anticipation of reaching the limit airspeed for chute deployment; however, deployment above 210 KIAS can destroy the chute. Actuation of the chute system to reach 210 KIAS simultaneously with loading of the chute is not recommended unless the risk is justified by very marginal stopping distance. Retain the drag chute.</p>
    <h2>Drag Chute Failure</h2>
    <p>If the drag chute does not deploy, shut down the failed engine (or shut down the right engine if there has been no engine failure) to reduce thrust and decrease stopping distance. Use moderate up elevon to provide as much drag as possible without lifting the nose wheel. The increased gear load may cause tire failure at heavy weight; however, tire failure may be acceptable since the tires will not necessarily disintegrate. Braking deceleration available is nearly the same for braked tire rolling and blown tire locked conditions with a smooth, wet surface. Locked wheel skids of 7000 feet on an ungrooved wet runway have left the wheels undamaged.</p>
    <h2>Braking On Wet Runways</h2>
    <p>Unless hydroplaning, good nosewheel and rudder steering characteristics can be expected. Well controlled stops have been demonstrated on wet runways with and without the drag chute, with all main gear tires blown and wheels locked, and with one engine shut down.</p>
    <p>Hydroplaning is a limiting factor with wet runway conditions and, although nosewheel and rudder steering remain effective, wheel braking force is nil until the tires can make contact with the runway. The aircraft tends to follow a trajectory and drifts with a crosswind.</p>
    <p>Except for the extended stopping distances, skids across or into dry runway areas are the chief hazard of wet runway stops. The wheels tend to lock-up and cause blown tires while sliding on a wet surface. Dry areas can destroy the tires due to increased friction or wheel spin-up. This allows the wheels to make runway contact and may ultimately destroy the wheels and brake assemblies.</p>
    <p>Even so, the aircraft can probably survive on the landing gear struts if it remains on the runway or on a hard surface overrun (assuming a smooth transition from runway to overrun).</p>

    <h1>Barrier Engagement</h1>
    <p>The following applies only to BAK-11 cable engaging systems installed with modified dual BAK-12 arresting engines.</p>
    <h4>Barrier Operation</h4>
    <p>The barrier is controlled from the control tower, and is armed prior to all takeoffs and landings. The pilot may call for disarming of the barrier if it is apparent that a safe stop can be made without it.</p>
    <p>When armed, the barrier is operated by the aircraft nosewheel and main gear as they roll over pressure-sensitive switchmats located in the runway ahead of the main cable. A row of switchmats located a short distance beyond the arresting cable prevents barrier actuation before the nose wheel has passed over the cable. The switches energize a timing computer which causes the arresting cable to be thrown up to engage the main gear struts. On engagement, the arresting cable is pulled out with a relatively constant restraining force to stop the aircraft within 2000 feet.</p>
    <h2>Operating Restrictions</h2>
    <p>The maximum recommended groundspeed for barrier engagement is 180 knots at all gross weights. The minimum groundspeed is 30 knots with the model 8200/BAK-11/12 installation (Beale AFB) and 15 knots with the model 8200-2/BAK-11/12 installation (Kadena AB). The barrier cable will not eject below these speeds.</p>
    <p>Optimum barrier engagement is perpendicular between the runway side stripe markings. A successful engagement can be expected, however, if the aircraft centerline is no closer than approximately 40 feet from the edge of the runway at the barrier. The probability of a successful engagement when closer than 40 feet to the edge of the runway is marginal, especially at high speeds.</p>
    <p>The nosewheel must be on the runway when crossing the switchmats. Steer to maintain runway heading and contact the barrier squarely.</p>

    <h1>Tire Failure</h1>
    <p>
      <span>Long runs during taxi or takeoff at heavy weight can result in blown tires. Critical temperature in the tire bead is approximately 455°F. Failure of a main gear tire during takeoff overloads the remaining tires on that side when takeoff weight exceeds 92,500 pounds; however, the remaining tires should sustain a 50% overload for the remaining period required to takeoff at maximum weight or stop</span>
      <u>if required cooling procedures are completed before takeoff.</u>
      <span>(See Figures 5-7 and 5-8.) Because each main gear tire loss decreases the available brake energy capability by one-sixth, ability to stop from high speed is largely dependent on the drag chute.</span>
    </p>
    <h4>Nosewheel Tire Failure</h4>
    <p>Failure of a nosewheel tire should not fail the other tire. It may not be possible to determine immediately whether a nose or main gear tire has failed. In either case, engine or structural damage may be sustained from tire fragments.</p>
    <h4>Tire Failure Procedure</h4>
    <p>Depending on airspeed and whether or not engine damage is indicated, takeoff may be preferable to aborting. The speed at which takeoff becomes preferable is close to acceleration check speed. Before refusal speed, attempt to determine if engine damage has been sustained.</p>
    <p>If tire failure occurs before acceleration check speed:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">

    </ol>
    <h1>Inflight Emergencies</h1>
    <h1>Bailout</h1>
    <p>Eject if loss of control is imminent, or if a safe landing or stop cannot be accomplished. Ejection expectations are:</p>
    <ol class="list-alpha">
      <li>
        <p>At sea level, wind blast exerts minor forces on the body up to 525 KIAS; appreciable forces from 525 to 600 KIAS; and excessive forces above 600 KIAS. The aircraft limit airspeed is below the speeds for excessive forces; however, when flying without a pressure suit, delay ejection until below Mach 1.0 and 420 KEAS (slower when conditions permit.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Successful chute deployment should result after ejection from zero speed and altitude.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Free fall from high altitude down to 15,000 feet with drogue chute stabilization is the quickest descent.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>During any low altitude ejection, the chance for success is greatly increased by zooming the aircraft to exchange excess airspeed for altitude. Ejection should be accomplished while the aircraft is level or climbing. A climbing or level attitude results in a more nearly vertical trajectory for the seat and crew member, thus providing more altitude and time for seat separation and parachute deployment. The zero altitude capability of the ejection system should not be used as a basis for delaying ejection.

    <h1>Forced Landing Or Ditching</h1>
    <p>Ditching, landing with both engines inoperative, or other forced landing should not be attempted. Ejection is the best course of action. If an ejection seat fails to fire, manual bailout is preferable to ditching or forced landing, since the aircraft will probably break up on touchdown.</p>
    <h1>Smoke Or Fumes</h1>
    <p>The crew cannot detect cockpit fumes when wearing pressure suits. Each helmet oxygen system is independent of the cockpit and suit air supply. Smoke can be eliminated promptly by dumping cabin pressure unless smoke is entering the cockpit from the air conditioning system.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>When cabin pressure is dumped, cockpit depressurization occurs very rapidly.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The pressure suits inflate if altitude is above 35,000 feet.</p>

    <h1>Emergency Descent</h1>
    <p>This procedure may be used when extreme circumstances exist or are expected to develop (such as crew emergency, impending loss of all fuel or control system hydraulic power, etc.) and minimum descent time is absolutely required.</p>
    <h4>Aircraft Control and Attitudes</h4>
    <p>A minimum use of flight controls is recommended for rapid descents during which aircraft control has become or may become critical (e.g., crew emergency, aft c.g. location with boost pumps inoperative). This may include nonturning flight until lower speeds are attained. If aircraft control is not critical (e.g., low oxygen quantity) a spiral descent is very effective in providing a rapid loss of altitude.</p>
    <p>The nose will be between 10 and 30 degrees below the horizon while descending through the transonic speed region.</p>
    <h4>Power Setting and Inlet Configuration</h4>
    <p>The configuration of restarts on, idle power, and aft bypass closed provides high drag for rapid descent, the least probability of yaw asymmetry due to unstart, and the best means of avoiding compressor stall and flameout. Inlet unstarts may be encountered near Mach 2.0 if engine rpm is below nominal idle rpm. (See unstart boundary with spike forward and forward bypass open, Figure 3-4.)</p>
    <div class="caution">
      <p>Some damage to the engines can occur during an emergency descent if initial CIT is high and rate of deceleration exceeds 1.0 Mach number in three minutes while above Mach 1.8; however, continued subsonic operation is permissible if engine operation appears normal.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Use Of Landing Gear For Drag</h2>
    <p>The landing gear may be extended at 400 KEAS when subsonic to maintain maximum rate of descent; however, the gear doors may be damaged if the gear is extended while above 300 KEAS or Mach 0.7. Gear extension at supersonic speeds is forbidden. Extending the landing gear above Mach 2.3 may cause heat damage to the tires and result in a hazardous landing condition. With gear extended, a large nose-up pitching moment occurs between Mach 1.6 and 0.9. Full nosedown elevon is insufficient to maintain 1-g flight at high KEAS and/or aft c.g. in this area.</p>
    <h3>Emergency Descent Procedure</h3>
    <p>If extreme conditions require a rapid descent:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>RESTARTS ON.</b>

          <span>Move the throttle restart switch to its aft position, or position both inlet restart switches to ON</span>

    <h1>Propulsion System Emergencies</h1>
    <p>Propulsion system components are: inlet, engine, afterburner, nozzle, fuel control, lubrication, fuel-hydraulic, and ignition systems.</p>
    <h3>Inlet Unstart</h3>
    <p>Inlet unstarts can only occur when supersonic after an inlet has been "started"; that is, supersonic flow is established inside part of the inlet. Unstart (shock expulsion) may be caused by inlet pressure behind the shock wave becoming too great or spike position too far aft. Improper spike or door positions can result from inlet control error, loss of hydraulic power, or electrical or mechanical failure. Unstarts are usually associated with climb or cruise operations above Mach 2 when at normal engine speeds; however, they may be encountered during reduced rpm descents at speeds above Mach 1.3.</p>
    <p>Between Mach 1.3 and 2.2, when near Military rpm, recovery procedures using restart ON may result in compressor stall.</p>
    <p>Inlet unstart characteristics may be similar to compressor stall characteristics and, in fact, stalls and unstarts may be intermingled. The term "aerodynamic disturbance" or "A/D", as used in the Inlet Unstart procedure, refers to either condition - - regardless of whether it has or has not been identified as an unstart or compressor stall.</p>
    <h4>Flight Characteristics During Upstarts</h4>
    <p>Unstarts are generally recognizable by airframe roughness, loud "banging" noises, aircraft yawing and rolling, and decrease of compressor inlet pressure (CIP) toward 4 psi. Fuel flow decreases quickly and the afterburner may blow out. EGT usually rises, with the rate of increase being faster when operating near limit Mach number and ceiling. A distinct increase in drag and loss of thrust occurs because of increased air spillage around the inlet and reduced airflow through the engine.</p>
    <p>The aircraft yaws toward an unstarted inlet. This yaw causes a roll in the same direction.</p>
    <p>A pitch-up tendency may occur due to yaw and roll rates developed during the inlet unstart. Pitch control problems can also occur during associated maneuvering and will be accentuated by low KEAS and/or high angles of attack, maximum altitude operation, aft c.g., high Mach, and any pitch rate which existed prior to inlet unstart. During the unstart, primary emphasis must be placed on maintaining pitch control to prevent nose-up pitch rates and angles of attack in excess of eight degrees. Reduce thrust asymmetry as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>Above Mach 2.8, inlet unstart may require yaw axis stability augmentation to avoid excessive sideslip and bank angles which could cause the other inlet to unstart.</p>
    <p>Aileron effectiveness is reduced at high altitudes and high angles of attack. Roll control may become critical if the unstart occurs on the down-wing inlet during a bank. At altitudes above 75,000 feet, aileron control may be ineffective in controlling roll during an unstart unless the angle of attack is immediately reduced. Aileron effectiveness increases rapidly as the angle of attack is reduced and only moderate aileron inputs will be required to control the roll. An excessive nose-down attitude may result in an over-speed (KEAS and Mach) if the inlets are restarted during a recovery maneuver. Therefore, maintain the restart configuration until speed and attitude are fully under control.</p>
    <p>The roughness usually clears after the forward bypass doors open and the spikes are started forward (manually or automatically) however, five to eight seconds may be required to clear the roughness. Roughness may persist until the spikes are fully forward during manual restarts at design Mach when aft bypass open has been required.</p>
    <p>Inlet pressure should be checked during recovery. Moderate CIP increases occur as the inlet "clears" (inlet in restart configuration with no roughness). If the inlet has restarted (captured the shock), moderate CIP increases occur when the spike retracts to restrict the inlet throat, and CIP then increases to normal pressure when the forward bypass door closes to the normal schedule.</p>
    <p>Unstarts caused by improper automatic spike scheduling will recur if the aircraft accelerates again to the unstart Mach. Manual spike and forward bypass door scheduling is necessary to accelerate further.</p>
    <p>If unstarts occur because automatic scheduling is closing the forward doors too much, check the aft bypass position and manually schedule the forward bypass door. In general, more bypass is required than for automatic operation and required bypass area decreases as Mach increases.</p>
    <p>Each time the shock expulsion sensor (SES) detects an unstart, the DPR schedule for the forward bypass door of the inlet that unstarted, is reduced 10 mpr (milli-pressure ratios). The DPR schedule for the other inlet is not changed. The lower DPR schedule commands the forward bypass door slightly more open when the inlet returns to automatic control after autorestart. A 10 mpr change in DPR schedule is so small it may not be noticeable to the pilot. If unstart occurred because the DPR schedule was set too high, unstart should not recur after one autorestart. If unstart was caused by a mechanical malfunction (such as a leak in the PSD8 lines that measure inlet pressure), the reduction in DPR is unlikely to prevent repeated unstarts and the forward door must be manually scheduled. The total reduction in DPR schedule on each inlet will not exceed 40 mpr regardless of how many unstarts occur.</p>
    <h4>Unstart Boundary Charts</h4>
    <p>Figure 3-4 shows unstart boundaries (a function of Mach, engine speed, and spike and bypass door positions). With spike full forward, the smallest roughness area below the idle rpm range occurs with the forward and aft bypass doors open. A more extensive area occurs with the bypass doors open, but with the spike moving automatically. In both cases, the onset of inlet airflow instability occurs earlier (i.e., at higher engine speeds) with the bypass doors closed. At windmilling rpm, heavy roughness will occur above Mach 1.3 unless the spike is positioned fully aft.</p>
    <h3>Inlet Unstart Procedure</h3>
    <p>Accomplish only those steps which are necessary to clear the inlet and return to normal operation.</p>
    <p>For inlet A/D:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>α WITHIN LIMIT.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Apply pure pitch correction (stick forward) first to eliminate the nose-up pitch rate and to maintain angle of attack within the limit. Alpha and pitch rate must be kept, or reestablished, within the APW stick shaker boundary. Rudders may be used to assist in roll correction, if necessary. Delay roll correction (with the stick) until pitch angle is controlled.</p>
        <p>Disconnect autopilot (or press the CSC button) if it is necessary to hold the control stick forward; otherwise, the autopilot will trim the elevons up, thus reducing nose-down control authority.</p>
        <div class="warning">
          <ul class="list-disc">
            <li>
              <p>Start pitch correction first. High angles of attack can develop if pitch rate is not controlled, and this can result in pitch-up. Maintain angle of attack and pitch rate below the APW stick shaker boundary. Decreasing angle of attack first assists roll control and makes recovery of attitude more positive.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span>Nose-up pitch trim above zero indication reduces down-elevon authority. If full forward stick is not sufficient to control angle of attack and pitch rate,</span>

                <span>.</span>
              </p>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Except for spike(s) and forward bypass door(s) in manual control, the automatic inlet restart system will automatically position the spike and forward bypass to clear the A/D. Above Mach 2.3, both inlets respond due to the inlet cross-tie feature.</p>
        <p>Observe CIP changes, and spike and forward bypass position indications to confirm normal action of the autorestart system (forward doors open, spikes move 15 inches forward then back to normal, CIP recovers to normal as forward doors close to normal). At high Mach, autorestart may not recapture the shock. If CIP does not recover after autorestart, manual restart is necessary to move the spike full forward and capture the shock.</p>
        <p>With only one forward bypass door in manual control, an unstart on either inlet results in automatic actuation of both spikes and the door in automatic control. If the manually controlled door remains in its position, an unstart and possible engine stall can be expected on that inlet, even if unstart of the opposite inlet initiated automatic restart. The forward bypass must be set 100% open by the respective restart switch or forward bypass control knob. The intermediate position of the throttle restart switch may be used to control forward bypass positioning of both inlets during the autorestart cycle; otherwise, proceed as follows.</p>

    <h3>Inlet Malfunction</h3>
    <p>When at supersonic speeds, inlet system malfunction is indicated by successive unstarts, abnormally high or low CIP, or engine stalls. Malfunction of an inlet may be due to failure of the spike and/or forward bypass automatic controls, aft bypass control, actuators, or electrical or hydraulic control power. The engine and hydraulic instruments and inlet control circuit breakers should be checked before employing the inlet malfunction procedure, to determine that an inlet malfunction is not associated with some other abnormal condition. The respective inlet restart switch, or spike and door position controls, individually control the left or right inlet. The throttle restart switch affects both inlets simultaneously.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <ul class="list-circle">
        <li>
          <p>Since nozzle failure will affect engine rpm, and rpm, in turn, affects automatic forward bypass door operation (supersonic), abnormal forward bypass door indications can result from nozzle failure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Use spike and forward bypass position, turn-and-slip ball, CIP, ENP, fuel flow, and rpm indications for malfunction analysis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In some cases when unstarts have occurred due to automatic spike control malfunction, automatic operation can be continued below the Mach at which the unstart occurred. Continuing at lower Mach may be preferable to using the manual spike schedule.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Failure To Schedule Normally</h4>
    <p>A combination of asymmetric thrust and fuel flow, and low CIP on one side during acceleration indicates that a spike and/or forward bypass has failed to schedule properly. This may be caused by failure of the automatic control(s) or of the spike forward lock to disengage when above 30,000 feet, or by circuit breaker opening. Normal spike and forward bypass positions and CIPs are provided by Figure 1-22.</p>
    <h4>Inlet Spike Unstable</h4>
    <p>Spike instability is reflected by fluctuations of the respective L or R hydraulic (SPIKE) pressure gage and by the spike position indication. If large-amplitude spike oscillations occur, the gage fluctuations are several hundred psi and a "hammering" may be felt. If spike instability persists, attempt to restore normal operation by cycling the manual spike control to match flight Mach number, then return to automatic control. If the condition persists, use the schedule for manual inlet operation until a different Mach number is reached, then return to automatic control. If the condition still continues, use the manual schedule.</p>
    <h4>Aft Bypass Control Failure</h4>
    <p>Malfunction of an aft bypass control is indicated by failure of the corresponding position indication light to extinguish after the aft bypass control position setting is changed. It may be possible to correct a malfunction by cycling the control setting. Control failure can result in reduced performance, inlet roughness or unstart, or engine stall, depending on the existing or subsequent flight conditions. Refer to Stall and Unstart Boundary charts, this section, for conditions to expect with the aft bypass, spike, and forward bypass in various positions.</p>
    <h4>INLET MALFUNCTION PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>This procedure should be followed when the pilot has identified a specific inlet that will not operate automatically, but has not identified the reason for the unstart(s). The procedure allows an orderly transition from a cleared inlet, in the restart configuration, to the appropriate manual inlet schedule.</p>

    <h3>Manual Inlet Operation</h3>
    <p>The inlet spike and forward bypass may be positioned manually if an automatic inlet control malfunctions. Manual control is also desirable if engine shutdown is necessary while at high speed, as the spike aft position results in minimum inlet roughness during descent to subsonic speeds. Refer to Engine Shutdown procedure, this section.</p>
    <div class="caution">
      <p>Observe altitude, speed, and bank angle restrictions during manual inlet operation.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Manual Control of Forward Bypass</h2>
    <p>Manual operation of the forward bypass is permissible with AUTO spike selected, or in combination with manual spike scheduling. The normal aft bypass schedule should be used with the manual inlet schedule, (Figure 3-5). Figure 3-6 illustrates the forward bypass positioning for manual scheduling and for standard-day automatic operation.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>During cruise, if one inlet is controlled manually, set the forward bypass control to 1.0 psi less than the CIP of the normally operating inlet. If both inlets are controlled manually, set the forward bypass controls to 2.0 psi below the CIP "barber pole".</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Manual Control of Spike</h2>
    <p>Manual operation of a spike is permissible; however, the effect on forward bypass positioning must be recognized. When an inlet forward bypass control is in AUTO and the spike control is in the manual range, the manual spike control overrides automatic bypass operation and causes the forward bypass to open 100%. The forward bypass must be controlled manually to obtain positions less than 100% open during manual spike operation. When both are set in the manual control range, spike settings above Mach 1.4 bias the actual forward bypass position more open than the bypass control position settings. The maximum bias is approximately 25% when the spike setting is Mach 2.3, and at least 10% bias when spike control settings are between Mach 1.5 and Mach 2.8. Refer to Figures 1-30 and 3-6.</p>
    <div class="caution">
      <p>During supersonic climbs above Mach 1.7 but before IGV shift to cambered, expect the manual spike setting to bias the forward door about 20% more open (see Figure 1-30). Forward door indications of more than 40% open may cause stalls in this region of the climb. These stalls usually can be cleared by closing the forward door to the setting specified in Figure 3-5.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Set spike position first when manual spike and forward bypass setting changes are scheduled. Allow the spike to reach its new position, then reset the forward bypass.</p>

    <p>Use the schedule from Figure 3-5 if manual inlet operation is necessary or desired. (Checklist emergency procedures include an abbreviated form of this table.) During manual inlet descent below Mach 2.5, a combination of restart on and high rpm results in compressor stall. Set 6500 rpm at Mach 2.5 and let rpm drop under the stall boundary condition. If an IGV lockout failure is suspected on the affected manual inlet, set Idle at Mach 2.0. Unless rpm is reduced below the IGV/internal bleed shift line in Figure 3-7, stall may be encountered when the internal bleed and IGV shift with the forward door near 100% open.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Risk of engine stall and flameout exists if the internal bleed and IGV shifts (to axial) during deceleration with an inlet forward bypass full open. Engine stalls have also been encountered during acceleration with the forward bypass failed open.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Compressor Stall</h3>
    <p>Compressor stall is usually indicated by thumping pulsations. Other characteristic indications are a loss of thrust, fluctuating CIP, RPM, ENP, or EGT at fixed throttle position, or failure of rpm to increase during throttle advance. Afterburner flameout with/without catalytic reignition can occur. At low airspeeds, compressor stall frequently results in engine flameout. Some of these stall characteristics are also descriptive of inlet unstarts, so accurate differentiation between stall and unstart is difficult. In addition, stalls and unstarts may be intermingled, making identification more difficult. A supersonic stall clearing procedure is incorporated in the Inlet Unstart procedure.</p>
    <h2>Compressor Stall Regions - Supersonic</h2>
    <p>Stall regions are shown in Figure 3-7. Maximum stall risk is at military rpm with IGV axial, aft bypass full open, and in restart. Minimum stall risk is near idle rpm with IGV cambered, engine internal bleeds open, with aft bypass closed. Stalls may be caused by transient airflow conditions resulting from compressor bleed or IGV shift, or by unstable or manual inlet operations. Other causes may be abrupt or erratic throttle movement, failure to momentarily delay throttle advancement during afterburner light, or improper scheduling of IGV or engine bleeds. Recovery from stall accompanying inlet unstart at high altitude is aided by reducing altitude. Below Mach 2.5, recovery is more consistently obtained by retarding the throttle.</p>

    <h2>Effect of Open Aft Bypass on Stall - Supersonic</h2>
    <p>Unless the shock trap bleed flow is restricted by secondary airflow back pressure, open aft bypass positioning generally has slight effect on engine stall at supersonic speeds as long as the forward bypass continues scheduling. Stall risk, particularly below Mach 3.0, is significantly increased when excessive aft bypass opening results in a closed, nonscheduling forward bypass. While below Mach 2.5 with an inlet restart switch ON, appreciable stall risk exists while near Military rpm and in Idle with engine start (external) bleeds open. During airstart, the aft bypass should be closed as rpm increases.</p>
    <h2>Effect of Manual Inlet Operation -</h2>
    <h2>Supersonic</h2>
    <p>During manual inlet operation, stall risk is increased due to greater inlet distortion and reduced inlet efficiency. Full open forward bypass or restart results in extreme stall risk when the IGV light is on (indicating axial position), and should be avoided.</p>
    <h3>Subsonic Compressor Stalls</h3>
    <p>In addition to the more readily recognized abnormal rpm, EGT, nozzle position, and fuel flow conditions (for which emergency procedures are described in this section), engine stall parameters include angle of attack ( α ), compressor inlet pressure (CIP), turbulence, wind shear, and rapidly changing ambient air temperatures.</p>
    <p>Engine stalls that occur during throttle advance are usually the result of excessive EGT uptrim. Engine stalls may also be caused by excessive EGT while at constant throttle settings, or malfunctioning nozzles, fuel controls, guide vanes, or engine bleeds. Engine stalls that occur when engine operating conditions are otherwise normal and when control parameters are not being changed may indicate an approach to dangerous flight situations. A low airspeed or high angle of attack condition, or both, may exist. Then, the stalls can be a result of low CIP (which is associated with low airspeed when at moderate to high subsonic operating altitudes) or result from high distortion in the inlet (which occurs at high angles of attack). Either can be dangerous when associated with operation beyond established flight limits.</p>
    <p>When subsonic at angles of attack above 10°, engine compressor stalls may occur; however, stall-free operation has been obtained at angles of attack as high as 15° (Aircraft limit is 14°. See Figure 5-3).</p>
    <p>Engine stalls are more probable when at Military rpm with CIT's below +10°C than at higher CIT's. This condition is in the rapidly changing portion of the EGT trim band. The probability of stall is increased at low CIP (high altitude, low airspeed), if there is a sudden decrease in air temperature, or if there is clear air turbulence, aircraft maneuvering, or open bypass door conditions. The effects can be additive.</p>
    <p>High angles of attack do not affect CIP directly; rather, they cause nonuniform pressure distribution (inlet distortion) and disturbed airflow at the engine face. An engine can operate normally with large amounts of distortion if at relatively high CIP (low altitude or high KEAS). If there is very little distortion, operation may continue at CIP's as low as 2.5 psi. If at moderate to high altitudes and at low KEAS or CIP, a small amount of distortion can result in compressor stall.</p>
    <p>Figure 6-2, which presents lift coefficient vs angle of attack, shows a generally linear slope for subsonic conditions away from ground effect. At angles of attack for normal subsonic flight (Mach 0.75 to 0.90), increasing load factor (or lift coefficient) results in an almost linear (equal factor) increase in angle of attack. Thus, if a gust changes load factor from one-g to two-g's, angle of attack will also double.</p>
    <p>Sudden increases in angle of attack, such as from gusts, do not change CIP significantly; however, such sudden increases do increase inlet distortion. Therefore, gusts can contribute to engine stall probability.</p>

    <h3>Compressor Stall In Descent</h3>
    <p>Compressor stalls may occur during descent at internal bleed and IGV shifts, especially if rpm droops below the military schedule. Often these stalls are self-clearing through reopening bleeds or recambering IGV. After a few of these cycles of shift followed by stall, the bleed or IGV shift is completed and stalls then do not recur. IGV Lockout prevents IGV shift but does not prevent internal bleed shift. With forward bypass open or inlet in restart, compressor stalls are likely at any rpm while above Mach 1.4 when the internal bleeds shift to closed and if the IGV shifts to axial. Stall and unstart characteristics are very similar and accurate identification of which condition exists is difficult. Use of the wrong corrective procedure can result in continued stall or unstart with eventual flameout. The following procedure is designed to clear severe or protracted stalls, or similar inlet roughness conditions which cannot be positively identified.</p>
    <p>For severe or protracted compressor stall in descent:</p>
    <p>Affected engine:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>Restart - ON.</p>
        <p>Do not use the throttle restart switch as both inlets would be affected.</p>
        <div class="warning">
          <p>If the L and/or R SPIKE SOL dc circuit breaker(s) are open, the respective spike will move only 15 inches forward of the auto inlet schedule when restart ON is selected or the throttle restart switch is set to the aft position. Without SPIKE SOL power, the first detent (center position) of the throttle restart switch for the respective inlet is inoperative. Without SPIKE SOL power, if manual spike is selected, all normal restart capability for the respective inlet is lost.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Throttle - IDLE</span>
          <u>immediately.</u>
        </p>
        <p>Retard the throttle to idle immediately after setting the inlet restart switch ON.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            <span>When near the internal bleed shift point (about Mach 1.8), setting the restart switch ON</span>
            <u>without</u>
            <span>throttle reduction can induce engine stall and flameout.</span>
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If stall persists:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="3">
      <li>
        <p>Increase KEAS.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>When subsonic:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="4">
      <li>
        <p>Restart - OFF.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Throttles - As desired.</p>
        <div class="caution">
          <p>If an engine stall cannot be cleared, shut down that engine and accomplish airstart.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>IGV Lockout Failure</h2>
    <p>The IGV light illuminates when the guide vanes leave the fully cambered position if the IGV lockout fails. The IGV and bypass bleed shift occurs at approximately 65°C CIT or Mach 1.7 while decelerating with reduced rpm, and at approximately 85°C CIT or Mach 1.8 when using the 720 EGT descent procedure. Mild self-clearing compressor stalls may occur during the shift. If protracted or non-self-clearing stalls are encountered, accomplish the Compressor Stall in Descent procedure.</p>
    <p>With a known IGV lockout failure prior to descent, set the throttle of the affected engine to Military above Mach 2.5 and 720 EGT at Mach 2.5, rather than 6900 RPM. Maintain at least 700°C EGT on that engine while above Mach 1.3. If the affected inlet was in manual operation, use the manual inlet descent procedure, but set Idle at Mach 2.0.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Monitor EGT, rpm, and nozzle position. 700°C EGT minimum should hold rpm at the military schedule and maintain nozzle governing. ENP greater than 70% open will result in less than military rpm; in this event, advance the throttle as necessary to maintain military rpm. Maximum rpm occurs near 100C CIT, as during acceleration. Mild self-clearing stalls may occur near 85°C CIT (at Military rpm) when the IGV/internal bleeds shift if EGT has dropped excessively.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Engine Flameout</h3>
    <p>Engine flameout characteristics are a loss of thrust, and a drop in EGT and rpm. If flameout occurs during supersonic descent, recognition will be especially difficult because of the similarity between normal engine instrument indications and those of an engine which has flamed out. The only positive indications of a failure in this regime may be low EGT and a lack of response to a change in throttle position. Fuel flow may or may not decrease, depending on the operating condition prior to flameout. Engine flameout can result from interruption of fuel supply, component malfunctions, or unstable inlet conditions with the compressor stalled.</p>
    <p>If flameout occurs with afterburners on, the operating engine's throttle should be retarded to minimum afterburning to reduce thrust asymmetry.</p>
    <p>For engine flameout, as confirmed by crosschecking EGT, fuel flow, rpm, and ENP, either accomplish the Engine Shutdown and Descent, or the Airstart procedure.</p>
    <h3>Double Engine Flameout</h3>
    <p>With both engines out, the hydraulic pumps provide sufficient flow for satisfactory control surface rates at engine windmilling speeds above 3000 rpm. Control capability is progressively reduced as speed decreases, becoming marginal at approximately 1500 rpm.</p>
    <p>Generator(s) in NORM continue to supply ac electrical power at engine windmilling speeds down to 3500 rpm, below which the frequency will begin to drop and then the generator(s) trip off. If both generators drop off, the battery and inverter provide power for DAFICS and other equipment on the emergency ac and essential dc busses. Without generator power, the boost pumps are inoperative and the probability of engine start is reduced, particularly if one or more fuel tanks are empty.</p>
    <p>Below 3500 rpm engine windmilling speed, when generator(s) in the EMER mode power the boost pumps, boost pump output decreases as engine windmilling speed decreases. See Figure 3-7 for a comparison of engine rpm with Mach. The essential ac bus is not powered by generator(s) operating in EMER mode.</p>
    <h3>Double Engine Flameout Procedure</h3>
    <p>With both L and R GEN OUT lights:</p>
    <p>Perform the Double Generator Failure boldface procedure to regain boost pump pressure. Refer to Double Generator Failure Procedures, this section.</p>

    <div class="warning">
      <p>Landing with both engines inoperative should not be attempted.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Airstart</h3>
    <p>If flameout is caused by temporary flow interruption, the throttle should be moved OFF immediately. Airstart procedures should be initiated after flameout; however, the reason for the flameout or shutdown must be considered before initiating restart.</p>
    <h4>Use of Crossfeed</h4>
    <p>If crossfeed is left open after an airstart is obtained, c.g. will move aft. Turn on an additional tank to the side where flow interruption is suspected before crossfeed is discontinued.</p>
    <h4>Airstart With Cold Oil</h4>
    <p>There are no special restrictions on airstarting and subsequent operation of the engines as long as oil pressure indications respond normally to rpm changes during the start. Operation above IDLE should be minimized after starting if oil pressure is not normal.</p>
    <h4>AIRSTART PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>The best airstart conditions are 375 to 400 KEAS and at least 7 psi CIP.</p>

Although airstarts have been obtained while in roughness (inlet unstarted), there is a higher probability of restarting the engine when smooth operation has been restored.</p>

    <h3>Engine Fire &amp; Engine Shutdown</h3>
    <p>Illumination of a FIRE warning light indicates a nacelle compartment temperature above 565°C.</p>
    <p>Engine shutdown must be accomplished after complete engine failure, such as seizure, explosion, or fire. Shutdown should also be accomplished for mechanical failure within the engine or its accessories to avoid or delay complete engine failure. Mechanical failure situations include uncontrollable rpm or EGT, and unaccountably abnormal oil pressure, fuel flow, or vibration. Refer to emergency procedures related to the engine oil, EGT, fuel, and nozzle systems, and to information in this section relating to operation with one or both engines inoperative.</p>
    <p>Windmill speeds below 3500 rpm result in generator lowspeed cutout and a 50% loss of fuel tank boost pump capability to the good engine if the bus tie splits. If below Mach 2.0 or decelerating through Mach 2.0, turn off the affected generator as soon as possible after engine failure to prevent bus tie split and assure full boost pump capability.</p>
    <p>Complete engine failure probably will not permit normal windmilling operation, but if the engine continues to rotate, cooling fuel circulates through the engine and aircraft cooling loops even with the throttle off. If the engine is not windmilling, an airstart should not be attempted since doing so could result in fire or explosion. Normal windmilling speeds can be expected after shutdown for some mechanical failures. Fuel cooling will continue unless the emergency fuel shutoff switch is shutoff or drive shaft power to the fuel circulating pumps is lost.</p>
    <p>Descent distance can be extended by decelerating with maximum afterburning on the good engine. Overall economy can be improved by decelerating with minimum afterburning or Military power on the operating side. Base the choice of A/B (on or off) on the power condition to be used for single-engine cruise. When no airstart is to be attempted, descend at 350 KEAS until subsonic cruise altitude is reached.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>With the spike forward, roughness intensity increases during deceleration between Mach 2.5 and Mach 1.3. Very severe roughness should be anticipated in this speed range if the spike is not positioned aft. Maximum structural loads imposed are severe, but are well below design limits.</p>

        <p>Positively identify the affected engine. Then retard its throttle to Military when operating at a higher power setting. Retard the throttle toward IDLE if the warning light remains on or if operating with afterburner off when the warning occurs. If supersonic, retarding the throttle of the affected engine to Military (or less) will result in deceleration to subsonic speeds.</p>
        <p>The thrust required for level flight may govern the power reduction possible on the affected engine if at low airspeed and heavy weight, as for fire warning immediately after takeoff. During landing approach, minimum control speed considerations may govern the amount of power advancement which can be used on the unaffected engine.</p>
        <p>Check for abnormal EGT, trailing smoke, or any other indicaton of fire. Use the rear view periscope and RSO mirrors. Request confirmation of fire from other personnel if available. In case of doubt, assume that a fire does exist.</p>
        <p>If the FIRE light extinguishes while at reduced power, and if there is no confirmation of fire, the flight may be continued with power reduced on the affected engine until a landing can be made at the nearest suitable facility. Land as soon as possible.</p>

    <h3>Single-engine Flight Characteristics</h3>
    <p>The loss of one engine will not result in loss of all hydraulic or electrical systems. If an engine fails just after takeoff, the large amount of asymmetric thrust will require bank toward the good engine and may require full rudder for directional control. Refer to Figure 3-2 for minimum single-engine control speeds. After regaining directional control, 7 to 9 rudder trim with bank and sideslip toward the good engine provide minimum drag during acceleration to climb speed. Charts showing single-engine climb capabilities are included in the performance data appendix. Acceleration to climb speed and climb to landing pattern altitude must be accomplished with Maximum thrust on the operating engine. During single-engine cruise, or after climb, reduction to zero rudder trim and use of bank and sideslip to maintain course provides minimum drag. A bank of up to 10 degrees is recommended, using no more than enough rudder trim to maintain course.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>During single-engine operation at low speed, a large rudder input may be required to maintain directional control under high asymmetric thrust conditions. A yaw toward the failed engine will cause a SAS correction proportional to the yaw rate up to 8 degrees maximum. Once the sum of the rudder and SAS inputs reaches 20 degrees maximum rudder displacement, any additional Yaw SAS input feeds back through the servo's internal linkage moving the rudder pedal suddenly back toward neutral an amount up to approximately one-half of the full pedal authority. In this case, the sum of the rudder and yaw SAS inputs remains 20 degrees, and no actual change in rudder position occurs even though the rudder pedal position has moved. As the yaw SAS input washes out (approximately 12 seconds), the pilot must continue to apply rudder pressure to compensate for the loss in SAS authority, or rudder deflection will decrease.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Trim Changes</h2>
    <p>Pitch trim changes can be expected while dumping fuel, due to shifting center of gravity. Directional trim is quite sensitive to changes in airspeed and power during landing pattern operation. At high speed, engine failure or engine flameout could cause yaw angle to become critical if an effective damper were not operating. Temporary thrust reduction on the good engine helps to counteract the asymmetric thrust. Follow-up rudder action is necessary. If large yaw angles develop, inlet duct airflow disturbances may cause the other engine to stall or flame out.</p>
    <h2>Fuel System Management</h2>
    <p>Fuel system management during protracted engine-out operation should consider maintaining center of gravity, making all of the fuel available to the operating engine and, when possible, continuing the fuel cooling of necessary systems. Refer to Fuel System Management with Engine Shutdown, this section.</p>
    <h2>Single-Engine Air Refueling</h2>
    <p>Single-engine air refueling procedures for actual and simulated operation are provided by Figure 3-9.</p>

    <h2>Single-Engine Cruise</h2>
    <p>Conservative single-engine cruise performance data for Military, Minimum A/B, and Maximum A/B thrust are in Figure 3-10.</p>
    <p>The cruise altitudes in Figure 3-10 are also the aircraft constant throttle single-engine ceiling capability. An altitude capability lower than shown on the charts must be expected on a hot day.</p>
    <p>Minimum A/B thrust and Military thrust provide the best single-engine cruise options. Military provides the best range performance, but penalizes altitude capability especially at heavy gross weights. Minimum A/B provides good range performance with an ample altitude capability.</p>
    <p>Maximum A/B single-engine cruise has poor range performance and should only be used when the required cruise altitude is higher than the minimum A/B cruise altitude capability. At least two fuel tank boost pumps are required for maximum afterburning fuel flow. If bus tie split occurs, manual selection of an additional fuel tank may be required. Simultaneous forward transfer and fuel dump should be avoided.</p>

    <h3>Afterburner Flameout</h3>
    <p>Afterburner flameout can result from engine stall, abnormal inlet operation, or insufficient airspeed at altitude. Afterburner flameout may be detected by a loss of thrust and by comparison of nozzle position indicators. The flamed-out afterburner nozzle will be noticeably more closed. Fuel continues to flow from the spray bars until the throttle is retarded to Military. A fuel vapor trail may be observed through the periscope. Correct the inlet, engine, or airspeed and altitude condition before attempting afterburner relight. At high Mach, the minimum airspeed necessary for afterburner operation is lower with spike scheduling than with spike forward.</p>

    <h3>Afterburner Cutoff Failure</h3>
    <p>If the afterburner does not cut off when the throttle is retarded to Military, attempt to vary the thrust by retarding the throttle below Military. The engine should be shut down if thrust cannot be modulated satisfactorily. After shutdown, the respective emergency fuel shutoff switch should be activated if the fuel flow and/or periscope observation indicates that the afterburner is dumping fuel.</p>
    <h3>Afterburner Nozzle Failure</h3>
    <p>
      <span>Nozzle malfunctions are indicated by the exhaust nozzle position (ENP) indicator</span>
      <u>and</u>
      <span>either excessive rpm fluctuations or rpm deviation from the scheduled speed. This may be accompanied by compressor stall and exhaust gas overtemperature. Precautionary engine shut down may be necessary.</span>
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Since nozzle failure will affect engine rpm, and rpm, in turn, affects automatic forward bypass door operation (supersonic), abnormal forward bypass door indications can result from nozzle failure.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Afterburner nozzle malfunctions may result from an exhaust nozzle control (ENC) failure, nozzle actuator failure, fuel-hydraulic pump failure, or a ruptured fuel-hydraulic line. A ruptured fuel-hydraulic line can be identified by excessively high fuel flow. It may not be possible to identify which one of the other causes of nozzle failure is responsible by using cockpit instruments. Therefore, the procedures address the nozzle position indication rather than the cause of the malfunction.</p>
    <h2>Nozzle Failed Open</h2>
    <p>A nozzle full open failure can be verified by failure of the nozzle to respond to throttle changes, and by abnormally high rpm at high power settings. If accompanied by excessively high fuel flow indications, the condition could indicate rupture of a nozzle actuator line in the engine fuel-hydraulic system. With nozzle failure, the main fuel control limits engine overspeed to approximately 350 rpm above the normal schedule; however, the actual overspeed rpm varies significantly with power setting. For example, at high altitude and maximum afterburner, the normal nozzle position is 80% to 100% open. A nozzle failure to full open results in a slight to moderate overspeed. As the throttle is retarded while in afterburner, the nozzle will normally close to approximately 60% open at minimum afterburner. A full open nozzle failure in this case would result in an overspeed approaching 350 rpm over the normal schedule. At military power, the nozzle would normally be almost closed to maintain the scheduled rpm and a full open failure would result in maximum overspeed. The accompanying EGT would be abnormally low and unresponsive to EGT trim inputs, as the fuel control will schedule fuel flow to restrict the overspeed. It is unlikely that the afterburner could be lighted while at such a high rpm and low EGT condition. At idle power, engine operation would be normal, as the nozzle would ordinarily be full open at that power setting.</p>
    <p>Engine overspeed can be reduced while in afterburner by setting maximum thrust and downtrimming EGT. Overspeed while in nonafterburning conditions can be eliminated by throttle reduction below military.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>If the thrust required is critical with the nozzle failed open, as during takeoff, it may be practical to retain maximum thrust —even with engine overspeed - - until safe airspeed and altitude are attained.</p>

    <h2>Nozzle Failed Closed or Toward Closed</h2>
    <p>A nozzle failed closed or toward closed condition can be verified by failure of the nozzle to respond to throttle setting changes, and by high EGT and engine stalls if in afterburner, or near idle power. Engine operation will be normal only near military power. If the nozzle failure occurs while in afterburner, immediate rpm suppression and engine stall will result — with a very high probability of engine flameout. If engine speed is allowed to decrease below 6100 rpm, the engine will normally experience a compressor stall and may flame out. If compressor stall is encountered, immediately advance throttle to increase engine speed above 6100 rpm. If subsonic, it may be possible to clear the stall by increasing airspeed above 400 KEAS and slowly advancing the throttle. If the stall cannot be cleared, the engine should be shut down. After engine shutdown or flameout, the restart possibilities with a closed nozzle are poor.</p>

    <h3>Fuel-hydraulic System Malfunction</h3>
    <p>Fuel-hydraulic system malfunction usually results from engine fuel-hydraulic system pump failure or leakage from a broken fuel-hydraulic system line, connector, or actuator. If a rupture occurs, pressure at the actuators may remain high enough for near-normal operation of the nozzle, bleed, and IGV systems. Complete system failure renders the engine nozzle, compressor bleeds, and variable inlet guide vane system inoperative. The nozzle may remain stationary or it may drift full open or closed, depending on internal nozzle pressure and external air loads; however, if the fuel hydraulic pump shaft shears, the engine nozzle will move to the 60% open position via the pressure fuel servo in the exhaust nozzle control unit.</p>
    <p>
      <span>The initial indications of fuel-hydraulic system failure are similar to those for afterburner nozzle failure, i.e. a lack of nozzle response to changes in throttle position</span>
      <u>and</u>
      <span>either excessive rpm fluctuations or rpm deviation from the scheduled speed.</span>
    </p>
    <p>A fuel-hydraulic system leak is indicated by a sudden step increase in total fuel flow indication as much as 25,000 pph and fuel streaming from the engine (or an engine fire). Engine rpm response and nozzle function may appear normal with persistent high fuel flow indications.</p>
    <p>For fuel-hydraulic system pump failure, fuel flow response to throttle, airspeed, and altitude will be near normal. In afterburner cruise, the nozzle will eventually move to full open. However, during subsonic cruise with the throttle below the afterburner range, the nozzle will normally remain in the failed position.</p>
    <p>The main fuel control fuel flow schedule limits engine overspeed at all power settings to approximately 350 rpm above the normal military schedule. Engine overspeed may not be nearly this great while at maximum afterburning and high Mach, since normal nozzle scheduling is nearly full open at these conditions. Some rpm control can be achieved by downtrimming EGT while in maximum afterburner.</p>
    <p>Inlet guide vane position does not drift with engine fuel-hydraulic system failure. The vanes maintain their settings, either axial or cambered, regardless of the existing IGV Lockout switch position, CIT, or engine rpm. If cambered, the guide vanes are held in this position by the latching feature of the IGV Lockout system. Fuel-hydraulic system pressure is required to overpower this latch, but the latch is ineffective if the IGV actuator line ruptures. If in the axial position, the IGV position light will remain on, and CIT must be maintained below CIT limits listed in Section V to avoid engine stalls and/or IGV blade flutter.</p>
    <p>The engine internal (bypass) bleeds tend to open or remain open if engine fuel-hydraulic system failure occurs.</p>
    <p>The external (start) bleeds are normally closed for all flight conditions (except when windmilling and, possibly, when idling at low airspeed). See Figure 1-11. They can be expected to remain closed with the fuel-hydraulic system failed. The closed condition may result in engine stall and flameout when at idle or at low rpm and airspeed, and airstart attempts after flameout for this condition would probably be unsuccessful. If the start bleeds remain closed during landing, rpm may "collapse" during the roll-out, and a damaging overtemperature will occur if the engine is not shutdown immediately.</p>

    <h3>Abnormal EGT Indications</h3>
    <h4>EGT Overtemperature</h4>
    <p>EGT overtemperature may be caused by intentional or inadvertent uptrimming, failure of the main fuel control to regulate EGT, malfunction of the automatic EGT trim system, nozzle failure, or airflow transients during engine stall or inlet unstart. EGT indication over 860°C illuminates the EGT gage red warning light. If the fuel derich system is armed, the Fuel Derich light also illuminates when EGT indication exceeds 860°C. The fuel derich light remains on until the derich switch is cycled to REARM (or OFF) even if EGT returns below 860°C. A relatively small rpm and/or fuel flow increase may be observed when the fuel derich is rearmed.</p>
    <p>Downtrimming EGT or throttle repositioning below Military will usually correct overtemperature unless the condition is caused by inlet airflow disturbances. In this case, use the appropriate compressor stall or inlet unstart procedures.</p>
    <p>
      <span>The Derich system reduces EGT by decreasing fuel flow to the affected engine(s) if 860°C is exceeded while the system is armed. The Fuel Derich system should be rearmed only</span>
      <u>after</u>
      <span>normal inlet or engine operation has been restored and EGT is within normal limits.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Overtemperature is usually more extreme at high altitude and/or low KEAS. EGT may become uncontrollable when near maximum altitude and Mach if the overtemperature is associated with compressor stall or unstart and if the Derich system is not sufficiently effective.</p>
    <p>Inlet airflow is severely reduced during unstarts or compressor stalls, causing the main fuel control to operate on its minimum fixed fuel flow schedule. Consequently, manual or automatic trimming and throttle reduction to IDLE have no effect. The fuel flow reduction accomplished by the Derich System may not be sufficient to reduce EGT while at extreme altitudes. It may be necessary to shut down the engine to control EGT if there is insufficient time to clear the compressor stall or inlet unstart by increasing airflow (increasing KEAS/decreasing altitude). Refer to Engine Operating Limits, In-Flight Shutdown, Section V.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Shutdown the affected engine for EGT:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>
          <p>Above emergency EGT limit (845° C above 40°C CIT; 865°C below 40°C CIT) and below 900°C for 2 minutes.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Over 950°C for 3 seconds.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>EGT over 950°C for more than 3 seconds or between 900°C and 950°C for more than 15 seconds results in severe turbine damage.</p>
    <p>The airstart procedure can be initiated as soon as flight conditions are suitable.</p>
    <h2>Auto EGT System - Malfunctioning Permission Circuit</h2>
    <p>The Auto EGT Trim System is operative if the EXHAUST GAS TEMP switch is in AUTO and the permission circuit is off (throttle at or above the military position and Derich not actuated). The Auto EGT Trim System is disabled by a solenoid-operated interlock switch which is powered when the permission circuit is on (throttle position below military or Derich System actuated). If the permission circuit malfunctions on (energized), only manual EGT downtrim is available.</p>
    <h4>EGT Gage Malfunction</h4>
    <p>If an EGT gage malfunctions, the indication may stick, fluctuate, operate erratically, or slew to zero or to the maximum indication of 1198°C. If the indication exceeds 860°C, the gage warning light illuminates and derichment occurs if the Derich system is armed. If EGT gage malfunction is confirmed, pull the respective L or R FUEL DERICH circuit breaker to return the deriched engine to normal.</p>
    <p>If the EGT gage temperature display malfunctions, the HOT and COLD condition flags should continue to operate normally.</p>
    <p>The flags should not be displayed persistently. Their operation is controlled by the Auto EGT Vernier Temperature Control rather than by the gage temperature display. Occasional temporary appearance of a flag while at or above Military indicates normal automatic trim system operation. EGT may be downtrimmed manually to test that the COLD flag will appear on return to automatic trimming while at or above Military.</p>
    <p>If only the EGT gage digital indication malfunctions, the Auto EGT system should be left on. Attempt to match nozzle positions and to minimize sideslip if using less than military power. If the afterburners are on, attempt to match fuel flow indications and minimize sideslip. The EGT condition flags (HOT and COLD flags) will operate normally.</p>
    <h4>EGT Harness Malfunction</h4>
    <p>The automatic EGT system (vernier control of HOT and COLD flags) and the EGT gage digital indication provide separate cockpit indications of EGT. The EGT is sensed by nine temperature probes arranged concentrically about the engine, aft of the second stage turbine. The nine probes are linked together by the EGT harness. The harness combines the individual signals from the probes into a single, averaged value which is sent to the automatic EGT control system and the EGT gage digital indication.</p>
    <p>A malfunction which causes varying resistance within the harness appears as an erratic and/or wandering EGT gage digital indication with associated HOT and COLD flag activity.</p>
    <p>Degraded power or loss of signal from a temperature probe causes erroneously low temperature indication from that probe. This lowers the average signal to both the EGT gage digital indication and the automatic EGT system. If the automatic EGT system is operating, initial cockpit indications are low EGT gage digital reading with the COLD flag in view. As the engine uptrims, EGT and fuel flow will increase, the nozzle will move toward closed, and the turn-and-slip ball will move toward the uptrimming engine. This type of harness malfunction could be insidious and is potentially dangerous. Severe engine damage caused by EGT overtemperature is possible.</p>
    <p>The automatic EGT system will continue to respond to an erroneous signal from the harness and will uptrim/downtrim the engine as long as the respective EGT switch is in AUTO. Discontinue automatic EGT operation, downtrim to assure that actual EGT is within operating limits, and control EGT by reference to fuel flow, nozzle position, and turn-and-slip ball position.</p>
    <h3>Abnormal EGT Procedure</h3>
    <p>Initiate this procedure if the EGT system has malfunctioned while operating in afterburner with Auto EGT on.</p>
    <p>Accomplish those steps necessary to assure that EGT is controllable within the normal limit (805°C above 40°C CIT) and to identify the cause of the EGT malfunction. Then, either continue the Abnormal EGT Procedure or complete the appropriate procedure for that specific malfunction (EGT Gage Malfunction, EGT Harness Malfunction, or Permission Switch Stuck On procedure).</p>
    <p>If an abnormal EGT condition occurs while the throttle is in Military, retard the throttle and downtrim EGT. With the EGT switch in manual, cautiously readvance throttle to Military (if continued operation with the throttle at or above Military is desired) and then initiate the Abnormal EGT Procedure.</p>
    <p>The Abnormal EGT Procedure is complete when a decision is made concerning further flight operations: continue with no in-flight restrictions, land when practical, or land as soon as possible. If EGT remained below the. emergency limit (845°C above 40°C CIT; 865°C below 40°C CIT) and manual EGT trim is operative, continue unrestricted. If EGT trimmed above the emergency limit but remained below 900°C, or if the EGT harness is inoperative, land when practical. If EGT was above 900°C, land as soon as possible.</p>
    <p>In all circumstances, if EGT exceeded the normal Emits (805°C above 40°C CIT; 830°C below 40°C CIT), record peak EGT and write up the magnitude and duration of the overtemperature.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Shutdown the affected engine for EGT:</p>

        </p>
        <p>If a HOT or COLD condition flag was present when the EGT trim switch was in AUTO, the EGT vernier was receiving power through the EGT TRIM ac circuit breaker.</p>
        <p>If there is no response to downtrim with the EGT TRIM ac circuit breaker in, the trim motor may be at the bottom of its trim range.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>With throttles matched, can downtrim achieve normal or low thrust?</p>
        <p>

          <u>away</u>
          <span>from the affected engine, lower EGT digital indication, lower fuel flow, and ENP more open. The fuel flow check may not be conclusive if the normal fuel flow was below 15,000 pounds per hour. Compare readings with the other engine. This analysis of the engines' instruments, and the cross-check of engine parameters and aircraft performance will assist in determining which system(s) and/or in-dicator(s) are abnormal.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Yes: (Continue step 4)</p>
        <p>No: Retard throttle below Military. (Go to step 8)</p>
        <p>
          <span>If manual EGT downtrim does not reduce</span>
          <u>thrust</u>
          <span>to normal, the EGT gage digital indication is probably accurate and runaway EGT uptrim may exist. Retard the throttle below Military until EGT is within the normal range; throttle movement in the afterburner range has no effect on EGT control.</span>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cautiously check EGT uptrim from a low-thrust condition.</p>
        <div class="warning">
          <p>Do not attempt uptrim or return to Auto EGT unless, with throttles matched, a low thrust condition is readily apparent on the suspected engine.</p>
        </div>
        <p>With throttles matched, cautiously uptrim toward equal thrust (turn-and-slip ball toward center, but do not go beyond center). It may be necessary to tap the turn-and-slip indicator to prevent the ball sticking. Cross-check EGT gage digital indication, fuel flow, and ENP with the other engine. Manual EGT uptrim rate is 8 C per second.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Is EGT uptrim effective?</p>
        <p>Yes: Recheck EGT downtrim to a low-thrust condition. (Continue step 6)</p>

      <li>
        <p>Is manual EGT trim effective?</p>
        <p>Yes: Check EGT dc circuit breaker. (Continue step 7)</p>
        <p>
          <span>Without EGT dc circuit breaker power to the Auto EGT power interlock, Auto EGT is disabled and the HOT and COLD flags will not appear (see Figure 1-8). Since de power for the EGT permission circuit goes through the EGT circuit breaker, the permission circuit is off when the circuit breaker is open; therefore, manual EGT downtrim</span>

          <span>uptrim are available (regardless of throttle position).</span>
        </p>
        <p>No: Monitor EGT and land when practical; if EGT exceeded 900°C, land as soon as possible. (Checklist complete)</p>
        <p>If EGT does not follow trim switch operation, the trim circuit, vernier temperature control, or trim motor may have failed. Also, trim motor switching may fail in a manner which prevents travel in one direction only. In these cases, the EGT gage digital indication should still be accurate. With throttles matched, monitor EGT digital indication, fuel flow, ENP, and the turn-and-slip ball to ensure EGT remains within normal limits.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Does EGT digital indication appear accurate?</p>
        <p>Yes: Use manual EGT trim and continue unrestricted. (Auto EGT trim malfunction)</p>
        <p>If manual EGT trim is effective and the EGT gage digital indication is accurate, it is probable that the Auto EGT trim system malfunctioned and that manual control will be satisfactory. Continue unrestricted operations, using manual EGT trim, if engine response and EGT indications appear normal and if the EGT emergency limit was not exceeded.</p>

    <p>With throttles matched, check for COLD flag appearance and Auto EGT uptrim. Cross-check performance and engine parameters with the other engine: the fuel flow should increase, the ENP should move toward closed, and the turn-and-slip ball should move toward the affected engine (do not go beyond center). The initial uptrim rate is 1°C per second if EGT is more than 10°C below the EGT trim deadband.

    <h3>EGT Gage Cold Flag Visible While Throttle Below Military Position (Permission Switch Off)</h3>
    <p>Appearance of an EGT gage COLD flag while the corresponding engine throttle is below Military indicates that its Auto EGT permission circuit is stuck off or inoperative. EGT will automatically uptrim while the throttle is below Military with this condition. EGT overtemperature is possible when the throttle is advanced to Military if the uptrim condition is not corrected.</p>
    <p>For COLD flag indication with throttle below Military (permission switch off):</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>Downtrim EGT.</p>

        <p>When the throttle is at or above Military, Auto EGT remains usable with the permission circuit failed, although its use is not recommended. If Auto EGT is used, Auto EGT should be disengaged before operating below Military. Check EGT while advancing power from below Military.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Accessory Drive System (ADS) Failure</h3>
    <p>
      <span>An accessory drive system (ADS) failure is indicated by progressive loss of the associated generator</span>
      <u>and</u>
      <span>the corresponding</span>
      <u>A and L</u>
      <span>or</span>
      <u>B and R</u>
      <span>hydraulic systems. The rpm, oil pressure, fuel flow, and nozzle position indications should also be monitored in case ADS failure is a symptom of or is followed by engine failure. The roll SAS servos will probably disengage.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Hydraulic, electrical, and environmental control system emergency procedures are incorporated in the ADS failure procedure. Steps for an immediate descent to subsonic speed are also incorporated. Do not reset the remaining roll SAS servo immediately after identifying an ADS failure. Shut down the affected engine if there is an indication of fire or for excessive vibration; otherwise, operate the affected engine as required.</p>
    <p>
      <span>With ADS failure at high speed, loss of the associated flight control</span>
      <u>and</u>
      <span>utility hydraulic system on that side can lead to difficulty in maintaining control of aircraft attitude. The affected inlet will unstart if hydraulic pressure is lost before corrective action is taken, as its forward bypass will not open when aerodynamic pressure moves the spike forward. The unstart cannot be cleared in this case until low supersonic speeds are reached. Actuation of the throttle restart switch immediately after recognizing ADS failure is of particular importance, especially if turning and if the failed ADS is on the down-wing side, even though the restart switch for the affected inlet may have been operated previously as part of the utility hydraulic system emergency procedure. Use of the throttle restart switch while reducing to minimum afterburning or military power produces a symmetrical thrust and drag configuration in the least time. This minimizes control problems and starts a deceleration. When adequate control has been established, the operative inlet may be returned to normal operation and up to maximum power may be set on both engines if it is necessary to delay further descent; however, land as soon as possible.</span>
    </p>
    <p>If both roll SAS servos are engaged initially, both will disengage immediately after loss of one primary hydraulic system if the aircraft has any appreciable rolling motion. This is due to servo logic which operates automatically when a difference in roll servo positions is detected. If there is any appreciable motion in the pitch and/or yaw axis, the corresponding SAS servo(s) for the affected side also disengages when the A or B system hydraulic pressure decreases below 1500 to 1300 psi. Refer to the SAS descriptions in Section I.</p>
    <p>The usable roll SAS servo should not be reengaged while banking, as roll coupling will disturb control in the pitch axis. Refer to Roll Axis Failure, this section.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Do not air refuel or land with only one roll SAS servo engaged.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The circulating fuel pump which is driven by the malfunctioning ADS will also be inoperative. This affects items in the fuel heat sink system which are listed on Figure 1-34. Fuel flow through the primary and secondary air conditioning heat exchangers is lost. If the left ADS has failed, fuel cooling flow to the pitch and yaw SAS gyros (supplied from the left heat sink system only) is reduced. (Since gyro cooling fuel is discharged into tank 2 from the gyro cans, boost pump pressure cam maintain some cooling flow.) Also refer to the Environmental Control System schematic diagram, Figure 1-80.</p>

    <h2>Loss of Liquid Nitrogen Supply</h2>
    <p>Loss of LN<sub>2</sub> supply to the ADS does not affect ADS operation during flight, as contamination of the ADS by oxygen does not occur until the ADS is completely cooled. However, loss of LN<sub>2</sub> must be reported following flight.</p>
    <h4>OIL PRESSURE ABNORMAL</h4>
    <p>Refer to Oil Pressure limits, Section V. Although not desirable, operation may be continued with oil pressure above the normal pressure range. Operation may also be continued with oil pressure in the 35 to 40 psi range; however, engine operation should be monitored for indications of failure, which include engine roughness or rapidly increasing vibration. Oil pressure below 35 psi is unsafe and requires that a landing be made as soon as possible using the minimum thrust required to sustain flight. The engine may have to be shut down.</p>
    <h4>OIL QUANTITY LOW</h4>
    <p>Cross-check oil pressure indication when low oil quantity is indicated by illumination of either L or R OIL QTY warning light.</p>
    <p>Disregard intermittent illumination of the L or R OIL QTY warning light if accompanied by normal oil pressure. Flickering of the light may occur, particularly during climb, if foaming or out-gassing of the engine oil reduces relative buoyancy of the tank float, resulting in a false indication of fluid surface.</p>

    <h3>Engine Instability During Supersonic Descent</h3>
    <p>Hot fuel (greater than 300°F) may cause engine instability during the first few minutes of the descent when using the normal descent procedure. RPM, ENP, and EGT fluctuations may occur shortly after A/B cutoff. These fluctuations can result in an inlet unstart, derichment, and possibly flameout on the affected engine. With derichment, the nozzle will fully open and the RPM and EGT fluctuations will be reduced or eliminated. Recycling the derich switch will restore nozzle scheduling and another unstart, derichment, and flameout may result.</p>
    <p>To reduce engine instability, retard the throttle on the affected engine until the nozzle is fully open, when RPM, ENP, and EGT fluctuations are recognized. Some intermittent engine roughness may be encountered which requires no corrective action. With automatic inlet scheduling, maintain RPM above 6500 to avoid inlet unstart. Normal descent procedures can be reestablished at Mach 2.5.</p>

    <h1>Aircraft System Emergencies</h1>
    <h1>Fuel System</h1>
    <p>Automatic operation of the fuel system provides center of gravity and trim drag control in addition to furnishing fuel to the engines. Fuel is also used to cool cockpit air, engine and accessory drive system oil, hydraulic fluid, and the SAS gyros. Abnormal operating conditions or emergencies affecting fuel system operation (such as generator failure) may affect c.g. control and operation of the fuel-cooled systems in addition to engine operation.</p>
    <h2>Fuel System Manual Operation</h2>
    <p>Manual control of the fuel system is accomplished through: the fuel panel crossfeed, tank pump and, pump release switches; the forward and aft transfer switches; and the essential dc bus circuit breakers for the automatic aft transfer and ullage systems. Manual control, manual pump selection, crossfeed, and/or fuel transfer is necessary for low fuel pressure, abnormal c.g. condition or c.g. trend, incorrect boost pump sequencing, single engine operation, or if using the emergency mode of the generators.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Manual operation supplements, but does not terminate, automatic fuel sequencing.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Crossfeed During Forward Transfer</h2>
    <p>
      <span>Forward transfer is less efficient with XFEED OPEN when fuel remains in tanks 5 or 6. During cruise, most of the fuel tr</span>
      <u>ans</u>
      <span>ferred would come from the operating tank(s) of group 2, 3 or 4 because of the aircraft nose-up attitude and the lower fuel pressure head that these forward tank pumps would have to overcome. Only a small forward c.g. shift would result.</span>
    </p>
    <h3>Fuel Quantity Low Caution</h3>
    <p>
      <span>Illumination of the FUEL QTY LOW caution light indicates that fuel is below the low-level float switches in both tanks 1</span>
      <u>and</u>
      <span>4. At 6.2 degrees pitch angle, the caution light indicates less than 5400 pounds in tank 1</span>
      <u>and</u>
      <span>less than 4050 pounds in tank 4. As the caution may indicate premature depletion of tanks 1 and 4 with ample fuel remaining in other tanks, confirm remaining total fuel from individual tank quantity indications. (TOTAL and individual tank quantity indications are affected to some degree by pitch attitude and accelerations.) If the quantity in either tank 1 or 4 is above the low-level float switch, the caution light can be extinguished by cycling the air refuel switch to AIR REFUEL and OFF. Proceed as described under Fuel Sequencing Incorrect if tanks 1 and 4 deplete prematurely.</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Fuel Quantity Low Condition</h2>
    <p>Confirm crossfeed open. Monitor total fuel quantity and land with at least 5000 pounds if possible. If immediate landing is not possible and a tanker aircraft is available, accomplish air refueling with any JP-type fuel. Subsequent operation, should be restricted below Mach 1.5 if refueled with other than standard JP-7 fuel. Flight operations may be continued with a FUEL QTY LOW caution light if the total fuel remaining will allow air refueling or landing with an adequate fuel reserve.</p>
    <h3>Fuel Pressure Low Warning</h3>
    <p>If one or both FUEL PRESS warning lights illuminate:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>X-FEED OPEN.</b>

        <p>
          <b>PRESS TANK 4 ON.</b>
        </p>

        <p>Check tank quantities, proper sequencing, FWD TRANSFER OFF and no streaming fuel.</p>
        <p>The L or R FUEL PRESS warning light may illuminate due to: a weak or inoperative fuel boost pump in a tank supplying fuel to an engine; a fuel manifold or fuel-hydraulic system leak; the use of afterburner at low altitude without additional boost pumps selected; the use of forward transfer when in afterburner without additional boost pumps selected; or fuel dumping when engine fuel demands are high.

    <h4>FUEL TANK PRESSURIZATION FAILURE</h4>
    <p>Fuel tank pressurization failure is indicated by the tank pressure gage and illumination of the TANK PRESS annunciator panel warning light. Liquid nitrogen quantity gages should indicate empty if the TANK PRESS warning light illuminates. Impending tank pressurization failure may be indicated by illumination of both the SYS 1 and SYS 2 N QTY LOW caution lights.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Do not continue flight above Mach 2.6 without nitrogen inerting of the fuel system.</p>
    </div>
    <p>No corrective action is possible after all liquid nitrogen systems deplete, except to limit maximum speed to Mach 2.6 and to reduce rates of descent to minimize the difference between fuel tank and ambient pressures. In descent, the fuel tank suction relief valve in the nosewheel well opens when slightly negative tank pressures occur. Limit rate of descent so that tank pressure does not become less than -0.5 psi to maintain normal maneuvering capability and structural safety factor.</p>
    <p>Air refueling and normal climb may be accomplished without nitrogen inerting of the fuel system. In climbs, the fuel tank vent relieves internal pressure when the tank-to-ambient differential pressure reaches 3.0 to 3.5 psi. Mach 2.6 must not be exceeded.</p>

With the right engine operating, the crossfeed valve should be opened as soon as tanks 5 and 6 are empty. Forward transfer as necessary to obtain a c.g. for subsonic operation. If the right engine has failed, tanks 5 and 6 may be emptied by successive forward transfer, leaving the crossfeed valve closed. This maintains c.g. properly and makes the maximum quantity of fuel available to the operating engine in case of subsequent loss of ac power.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>When operating on battery power, fuel transfer capability is lost and the crossfeed valve position cannot be changed. An aft c.g. condition can be expected as forward fuel is consumed unless tanks 5 and 6 are empty.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Fuel cooling will continue automatically and there will be an indication of fuel flow to the inoperative engine, if it is windmilling, unless its emergency fuel shutoff switch is actuated. This heat sink system fuel is either supplied automatically to the opposite engine's mixing valve, if the crossfeed and fuel shut off valves are open, or returned to tank 4.</p>
    <h3>Fuel Sequencing Incorrect</h3>
    <p>Incorrect automatic fuel sequencing is indicated primarily by the fuel boost pump lights. (A light may illuminate out of normal sequence, or fail to illuminate on schedule.) In this event, control the boost pumps manually until correct automatic sequencing resumes. Faulty fuel sequencing may cause a fuel EMPTY light to illuminate prematurely, or cause an abnormal pitch trim requirement (due to c.g. change by faulty fuel distribution). Forward c.g. requires increased power to maintain speed and altitude due to trim drag. If normed sequencing does not resume and manual sequencing is not practical, press XFEED OPEN (and transfer fuel as necessary) so that any available fuel feeds the engines.</p>
    <div class="caution">
      <p>Do not permit a manually selected fuel boost pump to continue running in an empty fuel tank. The boost pump will be damaged.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Crossfeed OPEN may be required to provide fuel to both engines during fuel sequence malfunctions.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>PARTIAL LOSS OF BOOST PUMPS</h4>
    <p>Partial loss of boost pumps may result from individual pump failure, sequencing failure, or loss of ac power at the generator bus. Partial boost pump failure may not be indicated by the fuel pressure low (L or R FUEL PRESS) warning lights unless the condition is associated with some other system emergency (such as generator failure with bus tie split).</p>
    <div class="note">
      <ul class="list-circle">
        <li>
          <p>Loss of pump 5-1 and either pump in tank 6 may trap fuel in tank 6A when fuel dump and/or forward transfer are on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Loss of pump 1-3 will temporarily trap approximately 2500 lbs of fuel in tank 1 while supersonic. When tank 4 has 3600 lb remaining, pump 1-4 is started. Manual selection of tank 1 pumps to obtain feed from pump 1-4 is not recommended since forward pumps 1-1 and 1-2 would be operating dry. Continuation of cruise with automatic sequencing could result in c.g. of 22% at end of cruise. Early selection of tank 2 plus use of manual aft transfer results in near-normal c.g. position in supersonic cruise.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Incorrect fuel sequencing and center of gravity shift may be the first indication. Proceed as directed for Fuel Sequencing Incorrect.</p>
    <h3>Complete Loss Of Boost Pumps</h3>
    <p>Use this procedure if both generators will not operate in NORM or EMER.</p>
    <p>Loss of all boost pumps can only result from multiple failures such as loss of both generators. The condition is indicated by illumination of the L and R FUEL PRESS warning lights, probably in conjunction with the L and R GEN OUT caution lights. If this occurs during takeoff, ground test shows that fuel tank pressurization will supply sufficient fuel to the engine-driven pumps to maintain engine and afterburner operation if all tanks are nearly full. Abort the takeoff if speed and runway length permit; otherwise, continue takeoff and land as soon as possible.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Fuel cannot be dumped with complete boost pump failure. Observe operating limits of Section V if a heavy weight landing is required.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Maintain a higher power setting on the right engine than the left engine to minimize aft c.g. shift as fuel is used.</p>
    <h2>Fuel Management Prior to Complete Pump Failure</h2>
    <p>When there is a possibility of complete pump failure; e.g., after loss of one generator, make successive forward transfers to obtain and maintain a c.g. of at least 22% (17% is preferable) until tanks 5 and 6 are empty. Crossfeed should remain closed until tanks 5 and 6 are empty, then press XFEED OPEN to minimize tank 4 usage.</p>
    <h2>Subsonic Cruise Capability Without Boost Pumps</h2>
    <p>The cruise capability remaining with boost pumps inoperative depends on fuel quantity remaining in tanks 1, 2, 4, and 5 prior to complete failure. Tanks 3 and 6 should not be expected to feed. Fuel can flow from tanks 1, 2, 4, and 5 as long as individual quantities remain above the minimums described below.</p>
    <p>The engines can draw fuel from tanks 2 and 4 with all other tanks empty if low power settings are used and a level or nose-up attitude is maintained. Since multiple failures are involved in loss of all boost pumps, it should be possible to transfer fuel prior to loss of all pumps and to continue operation of both engines for a "reasonable" time without pumps, using subsonic loiter power, speed and altitude schedules. The time available depends on location and quantity of usable fuel and the c.g. developed as the fuel is used. Full scale mock-up simulations indicate the following unusable quantities when operating at loiter speeds without boost pumps. (Values are approximate.)</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Tank 1</dt>
      <dd>2300 lb.</dd>
      <dt>Tank 2</dt>
      <dd>3400 lb.</dd>
      <dt>Tank 4</dt>
      <dd>1200 lb.</dd>
      <dt>Tank 5</dt>
      <dd>1900 lb.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Tank 4 quantity is critical. Both engines will probably be lost when the unusable quantity is reached in this tank, regardless of crossfeed position or quantities remaining in other tanks. The minimum value may be higher with XFEED OPEN. With crossfeed closed, the left engine will probably flameout when tank 2 reaches 3400 to 2800 pounds unless tank 4 reaches 1200 pounds remaining first.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>
          <p>Fuel quantity indications are inoperative without ac power. Quantities remaining must be estimated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Except where specifically noted otherwise, fuel system operating characteristics with boost pumps off are based on ground tests with a full scale mock-up of the fuel system. The tests simulated engine flow requirements, expected tank environments, pitch attitudes, and stable flight conditions. Fuel sloshing due to aircraft motion was not simulated.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>A gradual aft c.g. shift toward 22% can be expected, using symmetrical power settings, if tank 6 is emptied and a c.g. of approximately 17% attained prior to loss of pumps. If near 25% c.g. it will be necessary to advance right engine power to Military to maintain that c.g.; with symmetrical power settings, the c.g. will travel aft rapidly and the aircraft may become uncontrollable.</p>
    <p>Without generator or battery power, the inlet spikes remain locked forward.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>If the boost pumps are inoperative, there is no assurance of continued engine operation if one or more fuel tanks are empty. If one of the tanks serving an engine is empty, engine flameout can occur at any time if flight attitude, engine flow requirements, and/or fuel level in the associated tank(s) is such that the remaining head of fuel in the supply tank(s) cannot keep that manifold clear of fuel vapor or nitrogen gas.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Supersonic Descent</h2>
    <p>Use normal descent speed and Military power to minimize the rate of descent and maintain a positive deck angle. If the inlets are in restart, use the manual inlet descent procedure. At some point, probably below 60,000 feet, the engines will be receiving insufficient fuel flow to maintain full power. The engines may surge. If this occurs, reduce the throttle setting to eliminate "chugging".</p>
    <h2>Subsonic Cruise</h2>
    <p>Loiter speed and altitude schedules are recommended to minimize engine fuel flow requirements. The optimum loiter altitude is approximately 7000 feet below the altitude for long range cruise; Mach 0.75 to 0.80 is suggested.</p>
    <h2>Landing Approach</h2>
    <p>
      <span>A straight-in landing approach without abrupt nose-over should be started approximately 20 minutes prior to intended landing, using approximately 250</span>
      <u>KIAS</u>
      <span>to</span>
      <u>maintain a level or nose-up deck angle.</u>
      <span>The probability of engine failure during approach is increased if rpm is advanced during approach.</span>
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Bailout if a complete flameout occurs. Do not attempt a dead-stick landing.</p>

    <h4>SINGLE GENERATOR FAILURE</h4>
    <p>Illumination of an L or R GEN OUT caution light indicates that the respective generator has been disconnected. The GEN BUS TIE OPEN light may illuminate also.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>DOUBLE GENERATOR FAILURE</h4>
    <p>If both generators disengage automatically (L and R GEN OUT and L and R XFMR RECT OUT caution lights illuminated), the essential dc busses and the emergency ac bus are powered by the battery. Attempt to provide ac power to the boost pumps and the ac hot bus by placing both generator switches in EMER. If a generator in EMER is turning at sufficient speed and its windings are intact, the ac hot bus and half the fuel boost pumps are energized with power of unregulated frequency and voltage and the corresponding L or R GEN OUT light extinguishes. If both generators are operating in EMER, all fuel boost pumps are energized with unregulated power. The GEN BUS TIE OPEN light illuminates if either generator switch is in EMER.</p>
    <p>If a generator is operating in EMER (corresponding L or R GEN OUT caution light extinguished) and there is sufficient voltage, the transformer-rectifier on that generator bus will power the essential dc buses (corresponding L or R XFMR RECT OUT caution light extinguished and EMER BAT ON caution light extinguished); otherwise, dc buses will be powered by the batteries (L and R XFMR RECT OUT caution lights both illuminated and EMER BAT ON caution light illuminated). The dc monitored bus is locked-out in either case, by loss of transformer-rectifier power or by placing a generator switch in EMER.</p>
    <p>When regulated ac power cannot be obtained from the generators, the emergency ac bus is powered from the No. 1 essential dc bus through the instrument inverter (whether the No. 1 essential bus is powered by the No. 1 battery or an operating transformer-rectifier). The emergency ac bus never receives power directly from a generator in EMER (see Figure 1-45). The instrument inverter should automatically start if either generator is not operating in NORM and should automatically power the emergency ac bus (INSTR INVERTER ON caution light illuminated) if neither generator is operating in NORM. If the emergency ac bus does not receive power, place the emergency ac bus switch to EMER AC BUS (up) and check that the INSTR INVERTER ON caution light illuminates.</p>
    <p>The batteries will last approximately 40 minutes with reduced usage. Battery power is in use when the EMER BAT ON and the L and R XFMR RECT OUT caution lights illuminate. Systems not essential for flight or not usable on battery power alone should be turned off to minimize battery drain (see Figure 1-43).</p>
    <p>The essential ac bus is never powered with double generator failure, even with generators) operating in EMER.</p>
    <h4>Fuel System Remaining Capability</h4>
    <p>Boost pumps are powered by the left and right generator busses. If neither generator will operate in NORM or EMER, the fuel boost pumps will be inoperative. The ac hot bus, including the fuel quantity indicators and c.g. indicators, will also be inoperative. Refer to Complete Loss of Boost Pumps, this section.</p>
    <p>If only one generator is operating in EMER (corresponding L or R GEN OUT caution light extinguished) half the fuel boost pumps are energized.</p>
    <p>
      <span>When the generators are operating in EMER, the boost pumps</span>
      <u>must</u>
      <span>be manually selected.</span>

    <div class="warning">
      <p>With double engine flameout, if both generators trip off, perform the Double Generator Failure boldface procedures to regain boost pump pressure before attempting airstart.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Flight Control System Capability Remaining</h4>
    <p>With at least one generator operating in EMER (corresponding L or R GEN OUT caution light extinguished), ac hot bus power is available to the pitch and yaw trim motors. The pitch trim indicator, powered by the emergency ac bus, should be operative. The yaw trim indicator, powered by the essential ac bus, is inoperative.</p>
    <h3>Double Generator Failure Procedure</h3>
    <p>Failure or disengagement of both generators is indicated by illumination of both L and R</p>
    <p>GEN OUT caution lights. In addition, some or all of the following lights may be expected to form a massive display on the annunciator panel:</p>
    <h3>L/r Fuel Press Instr Inverter On L/r Xfmr Rect Out Auto Pilot Off Gen Bus Tie Open ANS Ref Emer Bat On</h3>
    <p>The A and L, or B and R HYD lights will also illuminate if a generator disengagement is due to ADS failure.</p>
    <p>With both L and R GEN OUT lights on:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>
          <b>ATTITUDE REFERENCE INS.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Select the INS to maintain a primary attitude reference.</p>
        <p>The ANS reference platform is inoperative without both essential ac and dc power. The pilot's ANS REF and the RSO's ANS FAIL caution lights illuminate. The pilot's INS REF caution light should remain off.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>The INS will continue to operate normally as long as emergency ac bus power is available.</p>
        </div>
        <p>PVD operation should resume when the ATT REF SELECT switch is in INS.</p>
        <p>The standby attitude indicator remains operative. If power to the standby attitude indicator is lost (emergency ac power for the 2 inch standby attitude indicator; essential dc power for the 3 inch standby attitude indicator), the standby attitude indicator will continue to display usable pitch and roll information for at least nine minutes.</p>

          <b>BOTH GENS EMER.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Set both generator switches to EMER and check the annunciator panel lights.</p>
        <p>With double generator failure, placing both generator switches in EMER offers the best chance of restoring power to boost pumps and to the ac hot bus.</p>
        <p>Check both L and R GEN OUT caution lights. If at least one generator resets, fuel manifold pressure can be restored to both engines by manually selecting Tank 4. The pilot's and RSO's fuel quantity and c.g. instruments and manual pitch and yaw trim will be available with ac hot bus power.</p>
        <p>Check the L and R XFMR RECT OUT and EMER BAT ON caution lights. A generator operating in EMER may provide sufficient voltage to operate its transformer-rectifier and supply the essential dc bus. The corresponding L or R XFMR RECT OUT light and the EMER BAT ON light will extinguish in this case. Monitor the dc loads as necessary.</p>

    <h3>Generator Bus Tie Open Light On</h3>
    <p>All electrical busses are still powered if the bus tie splits (GEN BUS TIE OPEN caution light illuminates); however, be prepared for the possibility of a generator or constant speed drive system malfunction. If either generator subsequently trips, the essential ac, emergency ac, and ac hot bus will automatically be powered by the remaining generator. DAFICS computers should automatically reset if power is momentarily interrupted during transfer to battery power; however, reset the affected DAFICS computer(s) and/or SAS sensors and servos if they do not automatically reset.</p>
    <p>
      <span>Do not take action if the GEN BUS TIE OPEN caution light illuminates</span>
      <u>unless</u>
      <span>the condition is followed by erratic ac power system indications (such as abnormally fluctuating lights and/or ac instrument indications). In this case, an abnormality in the right generator or its control or drive system is indicated. Cycle the right generator control switch to OFF momentarily, then back to NORM. This transfers the essential and emergency bus loads to the left generator. If either generator should subsequently fail, all loads (except its boost pumps and transformer rectifier) will transfer to the remaining generator in the least required time. Otherwise, a transfer time of up to seven seconds could be required if the right generator should fail with the buses split. The appearances of electrical failure during this transfer delay are similar to simultaneous double generator failure indications.</span>
    </p>
    <h3>Transformer-rectifier Failure</h3>
    <p>One transformer-rectifier can supply the normal electrical demands. If a single transformer-rectifier fails, no action is required.</p>
    <p>A double failure of the transformer-rectifiers is indicated by illumination of both L and R XFMR RECT OUT caution lights. Generator power is removed from all of the dc buses, but the batteries automatically supply power to the essential dc buses (indicated when EMER BAT ON caution light illuminates). DAFICS computers should automatically reset if power is momentarily interrupted during transfer to battery power; however, the affected DAFICS computer(s) and/or SAS sensors/servos should be reset if they do not automatically reset.</p>
    <p>
      <span>With</span>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Emergency AC Bus Power Loss</h3>
    <p>Loss of emergency ac bus power is indicated by loss of the A, B and M computers and, after ten seconds, the INS. The following power OFF warning flags should appear: INS, TDI, ADI, Angle of Attack Indicator and the 2 inch Standby Attitude Indicator. (The 3 inch Standby Attitude Indicator is powered by dc power and is not affected.)</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>With emergency ac bus failure, second condition SAS failure limits apply.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Power may be restored by moving the emergency ac bus switch to the EMER AC BUS (up) position. Actuation of the emergency ac bus switch may be accompanied by heading and attitude indication transients. The DAFICS computers reset automatically within one second.</p>
    <p>Expect loss of all DAFICS computers and INS until EMER AC BUS is selected. All DAFICS computers should automatically reset when emergency ac power is restored; however, any disengaged computers or SAS sensors/servos should be reset if they do not automatically reset.</p>
    <p>If emergency ac power is not restored to the INS within 10 seconds, the INS platform may be lost. In this case, use the Standby Attitude Indicator and complete an INS inflight alignment.</p>
    <h1>Hydraulic System</h1>
    <p>With both engines out, the hydraulic pumps provide sufficient flow for satisfactory flight control system operation at windmilling speeds above 3000 rpm. Reduced control system capability is available down to a windmilling speed of approximately 1500 rpm. With one engine windmilling, all flight control and most utility services are supplied by the operating engine hydraulic systems. The windmilling engine utility system pressure and flow may be sufficient to supply service until the engine is almost stopped.</p>
    <h3>Abnormal Hydraulic Pressure</h3>
    <p>Steady hydraulic system pressures between 2200 and 3000 psi, and above 3500 psi, are considered abnormal. An abnormal pressure should be corrected before flight. Although not desirable, unrestricted operation may be continued if abnormal pressure is observed during flight; however, system operation should be monitored for indications of low quantity or degraded performance and the condition must be reported after landing. Transient pressure fluctuations are not considered abnormal when they can be associated with system demand.</p>
    <h3>L&amp;r (utility) Hydraulic Systems</h3>
    <p>Illumination of an L or R HYD warning light indicates low fluid quantity for that system (not low quantity and/or low pressure as the A and B HYD warning lights). Low pressure is indicated by the corresponding hand of the L and R hydraulic system (SPIKE) pressure gage. If L system pressure becomes less than 2200 psi during gear retraction, an automatic crossover to the R system continues until retraction is completed. If L system has failed, the Emergency Gear Extension procedure must be used to lower the landing gear.</p>
    <h3>L And/or R Hydraulic System Failed</h3>
    <p>Assume that an L or R hydraulic system has failed when its pressure indication remains below 2200 psi or its L or R HYD annunciator warning light remains illuminated. If at high Mach, a descent should be started in either case. Subsonic operating speeds are recommended; however, operation may be continued at intermediate supersonic speeds, when necessary, if an aft-bypass-closed and restart configuration is achieved and the engine inlet guide vanes maintained in the cambered position (IGV LOCKOUT). Sustained operation at speeds which result in engine internal bleed shifting should be avoided. Refer to Figures 3-4 and 3-7 for Unstart and Compressor Stall Boundary conditions for various inlet configurations.</p>

    <h4>A AND B HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS</h4>
    <p>The loss of either A or B hydraulic system fluid quantity or pressure illuminates the corresponding A or B HYD annunciator warning light. The A and B hydraulic pressure gage will indicate complete failure of a system. If the A or B hydraulic system fails, the control forces will not change. Either system will operate the control surfaces, but at a slower rate and with some reduction in available control at higher KEAS and Mach. Airspeed reduction with a single hydraulic system is a precaution which allows for the reduction in available hinge moment capability. The APW system stick pusher is inoperative if the A system fails. Monitor system operation closely and attempt to determine if complete failure is imminent. Prepare for ejection prior to complete failure.</p>
    <h4>Effect of System Loss on SAS</h4>
    <p>Manual disengagement of the failed A or B hydraulic system SAS servos is necessary to regain normal SAS damping capability in all channels, as a hydraulic system failure is not sensed directly by DAFICS. The signal gain of the operating yaw servo is doubled automatically by disengagement of the servo for the failed hydraulic system.</p>
    <p>It is necessary to recycle the operating roll SAS servo to regain damping in roll. The useable roll SAS servo should not be reengaged while banking, as roll coupling will disturb control in the pitch axis. Refer to Roll Axis Failures, this section.</p>

    <h4>TRIM FAILURES</h4>
    <p>
      <span>Pitch, yaw or roll trim may fail inoperative or may runaway. Runaway trim failures in pitch may occur at the slow rate (0.113°/sec) if due to a runaway automatic trim motor, or at fast rate (1.13°/sec) if due to a runaway manual trim motor. A slow rate runaway malfunction will be manifest by the need for constant manual pitch trimming. A fast rate runaway pitch trim will result in a moderately rapid change in pitch attitude or stick forces. If the cause is a sticky manual pitch trim switch, a rapid oscillation may develop if the pilot applies corrective pitch trim inputs. The possibility of manual trim runaway can be minimized by manually centering the trim switch following each trim application. The runaway yaw trim rate is 0.90°/sec. The roll trim rate is.96°/sec. Runaway yaw trim will be accompanied by rudder pedal deflections as the surfaces move. Runaway pitch or roll trim will</span>

    <p>With manual pitch trim inoperative and autotrim available, engagement of the pitch autopilot will gradually correct an out-of-pitchtrim condition. This will relieve the pilot from maintaining stick deflection to maintain attitude. The pitch autopilot will not remain engaged when the auto trim motor is inoperative because DAFICS will disengage the autopilot when autotrim does not follow autopilot inputs.</p>
    <p>If the trim malfunction is a runaway in the roll axis, right or left stick deflection will be required for the rest of the flight, but stick force will not be more than normally required for the same amount of deflection. If the malfunction was a runaway in the yaw axis, rudder pedal force will be required to maintain neutral rudder pedal position.</p>
    <h1>Stability Augmentation System (SAS)</h1>
    <p>SAS disengagements may result from failures of: servo(s), multiple sensors, multiple DAFICS computer failures, or electrical power fluctuations and failures. Disengagement or loss of effectiveness may also occur as a result of complete or partial loss of A or B system hydraulic power. Failure of SAS sensors and servos is indicated by illumination of the master caution light, the SAS OUT annunciator caution light, and one or more of the indicator lights on the SAS control panel.</p>
    <p>A steady YAW SENSOR light indicates a yaw rate gyro failure. A flashing YAW SENSOR light indicates failure of a lateral accelerometer. If both the yaw rate gyro and lateral accelerometer in the same yaw sensor fail, that YAW SENSOR light will illuminate steady. DAFICS provides analytical redundancy for yaw rate, but not for lateral acceleration.</p>
    <p>No SAS capability is lost as a result of a single DAFICS computer failure. SAS sensor redundancy is reduced in pitch and yaw by any dual computer failure. Also, SAS channel A is lost in pitch and yaw due to servo disengagements if the A and M computers fail. SAS channel B is lost in pitch and yaw due to servo disengagements if the B and M computers fail. All roll SAS is lost if A and B computers fail. Refer to DAFICS Computer Failures, this section.</p>
    <p>All SAS is disengaged if all three DAFICS computers fail. SAS is functionally Inoperative while DAFICS is in the ground test mode (DAFICS preflight BIT TEST or FAIL light illuminated steady).</p>

    <h3>Pitch Or Yaw Axis "first" Condition Failure</h3>
    <p>A "first" condition failure exists after the SAS Emergency Operation procedure has been accomplished and either an A or B SAS servo is inoperative in the pitch and/or yaw axis. "First" condition failure limitations are also observed for: dual pitch sensor or dual yaw rate gyro failures; and single pitch sensor or single yaw rate gyro failure with ANR failure (DAFICS Preflight BIT red FAIL light flashing).</p>
    <h2>Sensors</h2>
    <p>
      <span>There is no combination of pitch or yaw sensor failures that can fail only one channel in either axis. Both SAS channels operate if one sensor is available in that axis. No SAS channel is lost in pitch or yaw as a result of a single sensor failure; however, "first" condition failure limitations should be observed for single pitch sensor or yaw-rate gyro failure</span>
      <u>with</u>
      <span>ANR failure. If analytical redundancy is operative, no pitch or yaw SAS channel is lost if two pitch sensors or two yaw rate gyros are lost; however, "first" condition failure limitations should be observed for dual pitch sensor or dual yaw rate gyro failures.</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Servos</h2>
    <p>A "first" condition failure exists after the SAS Emergency Operation procedure has been accomplished and one servo light remains on (A PITCH SERVO, B PITCH SERVO, A YAW SERVO, or B YAW SERVO) or one servo light remains on in each axis (any combination of one PITCH SERVO and one YAW SERVO light). Aircraft flight characteristics do not change as a result of a failure or combination of failures which leaves one A or B servo operating in each axis.</p>
    <h2>Computers</h2>
    <p>No SAS capability is lost as a result of a single computer failure. SAS channel A is lost in pitch and yaw due to servo disengagement if the A and M computers faiL SAS channel B is lost in pitch and yaw due to servo disengagement if the B and M computers fail.</p>

    <h3>Pitch Or Yaw Axis "second" Condition Failure</h3>
    <p>A "second" condition failure exists when both SAS servos disengage in the same axis.</p>
    <h4>Pitch SAS Disengaged Characteristics</h4>
    <p>Normally, pitch SAS opposes pitch rates that result from control stick inputs. Without pitch SAS, the aircraft pitch rate and load factor response to a pilot input is greater than the response to the same stick movement or stick force when pitch SAS is operating. With pitch SAS off, longitudinal overcontrol is likely, particularly at high Mach (where static margin is low and normal pitch SAS gain is high). Observance of "second" failure limits is required, and descent to subsonic speed is recommended when practical. Air refueling and landing may present difficulties in maintaining precise attitude control. With SAS off, divergent speed and attitude tendencies occur slowly enough to be controllable. Stability improves when the c.g. is moved forward (see Stability Characteristics, Sec. VI). Minimum airspeed at or above normal pattern speeds (i.e. angle of attack at or below 10°) is recommended until landing. See Figure 3-15.</p>
    <h4>Pitch Sensors</h4>
    <p>Due to analytical redundancy models in the DAFICS computers, neither pitch SAS channel is lost until all three pitch sensors fail, or two pitch sensors and analytical redundancy fail. These triple failures will cause the A, B, and M PITCH SENSOR lights to illuminate and both pitch SAS channels to disengage. In this case, the pitch servo lights on the SAS control panel will not illuminate.</p>
    <h4>Pitch Servos</h4>
    <p>A failure of both pitch servos (A PITCH SERVO and B PITCH SERVO lights on) will cause both pitch SAS channels to disengage.</p>
    <h4>Yaw SAS Disengaged Characteristics</h4>
    <p>At high Mach, neutral to slightly positive stability exists and there is little damping of yaw oscillations after they commence. Above Mach 2.8, automatic scheduling of the inlets may induce neutrally damped directional oscillations. Directional and roll control could become difficult (as a result of large bank angles generated by yawing motion) if an unstart or flameout occurs above Mach 2.9. Pilot rudder inputs usually aggravate this condition. These conditions could also result in excessive rudder surface loads above 400 KEAS. Use of both restart switches is recommended while decelerating to avoid asymmetric nacelle drag or unstarts.</p>
    <h4>Yaw Sensors</h4>
    <p>Due to yaw rate analytical redundancy models in the DAFICS computers, neither yaw SAS channel is lost until all three yaw rate gyros fail or two yaw rate gyros and analytical redundancy fail. These triple failures will cause the A, B, and M YAW</p>
    <p>SENSOR lights to illuminate steady and both yaw SAS channels to disengage. Because analytical redundancy is not provided for lateral accelerometers, the failure of any two lateral accelerometers will cause the A, B, and M YAW SENSOR lights to illuminate flashing and both yaw channels to disengage. In either case, the YAW SERVO lights on the SAS control panel will not illuminate.</p>
    <h2>Yaw Servos</h2>
    <p>Failure of both yaw servos (A YAW SERVO and B YAW SERVO lights on) will cause both yaw SAS channels to disengage.</p>
    <h4>Computers</h4>
    <p>
      <span>If all three DAFICS computers fail, all SAS channels will disengage. In this case, all SAS capability is lost and the A CMPTR OUT, B CMPTR OUT and M CMPTR OUT annunciator lights illuminate. SAS disengagement will</span>
      <u>not</u>
      <span>be indicated by lights on the SAS control panel. Refer to the A, B, and M Computers Out procedure, this section, which incorporates appropriate SAS emergency actions.</span>
    </p>
    <p>If two DAFICS computers are inoperative, SAS redundancy is degraded. The loss of a servo or sensor in combination with a dual computer failure may result in a "second" condition SAS failure. Appropriate SAS emergency procedures are incorporated in computer-out procedures. Refer to A and B, (A and M) or (B and M) Computers Out procedure as appropriate.</p>
    <h4>PITCH OR YAW AXIS "SECOND" CONDITION FAILURE PROCEDURE</h4>

    <h3>Roll Axis Failures</h3>
    <p>
      <span>With one ROLL SERVO failed, some undesirable cross-coupling may occur during single roll SAS channel operation, particularly during turns. This appears as small amplitude oscillations in the pitch and yaw axes. Roll coupling occurs because the A and B roll SAS servos only operate through their left and right side elevons. With the "A" roll servo off, for example, the "B" servo only supplies stability augmentation through the right side elevons. However, the pitch axis SAS channel which remains will continue to operate through the elevons on both sides of the aircraft. A disturbance in the roll axis which is resisted by the B roll SAS servo results in a nose-up or nose-down pitch signal to the right side elevons. There is no balancing roll signal to the left side elevons if the A roll SAS servo is off, and a pitch transient is introduced. When this happens, the pitch SAS will immediately resist any disturbance in the longitudinal axis which is introduced by the right side elevons. It reacts against the roll SAS command, and deflects the elevons on</span>
      <u>both</u>
      <span>sides toward the opposite direction. The result is a pitch transient in the opposite direction to that of the original roll SAS input. The magnitude of the transient and the number of resultant transients depends largely on the strength of the original disturbance.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Roll coupling can occur in wings-level or turning flight. The effect is not unduly hazardous unless compounded by other abnormal or emergency situations - - such as an unstart. Therefore, the usable roll SAS servo can be reengaged when level, if desired, and autopilot AUTO NAV can be engaged. As a precaution, the roll SAS can be disengaged before turns.</p>
    <p>Scheduled activity may be continued for the remainder of the flight with a single roll SAS channel operating. The roll autopilot may be engaged and AUTO NAV used as desired.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <ul class="list-circle">
        <li>
          <p>Operation with both roll channels disengaged is permitted without limitation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With an engine failure at low speed or while reducing airspeed, loss of hydraulic power from the windmilling engine may cause failure of that roll SAS channel and simultaneous automatic disengagement of the other roll channel.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Use of Roll SAS for Single-Engine Landing</h2>
    <p>To avoid changes in pitch control characteristics at a critical time during singleengine landings, make the approach and landing with all roll SAS off. With both roll channels off, roll response is increased and the airplane feels lighter in roll. Therefore, the roll channels should be turned off early enough to allow the pilot to become accustomed to the new feel prior to landing.</p>
    <h4>Roll SAS Failure at High Speed</h4>
    <p>A second roll SAS failure while at high speed will probably be indicated by loss of roll damping or possibly illumination of both roll servo lights.</p>
    <p>Loss of ANR (DAFICS Preflight BIT light flashing red) with a single roll sensor failure causes loss of all roll SAS.</p>
    <h4>Operation with Roll SAS Disengaged</h4>
    <p>Failure or intentional disengagement of both roll SAS channels is expected to increase pilot fatigue, reduce mission effectiveness, and will disable the roll autopilot and AUTO NAV; however, no hazard to safety should result and there are no flight restrictions for continued operation.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Do not air refuel or land with only one roll SAS servo engaged.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Roll SAS Failure Procedure</h3>
    <p>This procedure is only initiated after the SAS Emergency Operation procedure is complete.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>With A and B CMPTR OUT lights illuminated, roll A &amp; B SENSOR and SERVO lights and roll A &amp; B channels are inoperative.</p>
    </div>
    <p>With A or B ROLL SERVO light illuminated:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>A and B roll servo switches - Off.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Operative roll servo switch - ON.</p>
        <p>A SERVO failed, engage channel B,</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>B SERVO failed, engage channel A.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>With both ROLL SERVO lights illuminated:</p>

      <li>
        <p>A and B roll servo switches - Off.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A roll servo switch - ON.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a hard-over obtained or if no improvement:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="5">
      <li>
        <p>A roll servo switch - Off.</p>

      </li>

    <p>If a hard-over obtained or if no improvement:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="7">
      <li>
        <p>A and B roll servo switches - Off.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For ROLL SENSOR light illuminated:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="8">
      <li>
        <p>Check for normal roll damping.</p>
        <p>If normal, a single ROLL SENSOR has failed. Single sensor failure will not disengage or degrade roll SAS.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If abnormal:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="9">
      <li>
        <p>A and B roll SAS servo switches - Off.</p>
        <p>Both ROLL SENSORS have failed and both roll SAS servos have disengaged.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>With ROLL SENSOR light illuminated and ANR failure (DAFICS Preflight BIT light flashing):</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="10">
      <li>
        <p>A and B roll SAS servo switches - Off.</p>
        <p>Roll SAS cannot operate on one sensor unless ANR is available.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Analytical Redundancy Failure</h3>
    <p>If the BIT FAIL light illuminates flashing, analytical redundancy for pitch, roll, and/or yaw SAS sensors has failed. DAFICS fails ANR if pitch, yaw, or roll rates derived from movement of the inertial platform selected by the pilot (ANS or INS) do not compare with SAS rate gyros in an axis when two SAS rate gyros are operating in that axis. In effect, the two rate gyros are voting out the inertial platform. Because a platform error may be present, the PVD is inhibited when ANR failure is indicated.</p>
    <p>Without analytical redundancy, two sensor failures in the pitch and the yaw axis and a single sensor failure in the roll axis will result in loss of all SAS in that axis ("second" condition SAS failure).</p>
    <p>A transient failure of analytical redundancy may be cleared by cycling the ATT REF SELECT switch. If the BIT FAIL light continues to flash after cycling the ATT REF SELECT switch, the selected attitude reference may be marginally degraded or unreliable. Analytical redundancy for SAS may be regained by setting the ATT REF SELECT switch to the opposite source, if desired.</p>
    <h3>Analytical Redundancy Failure Procedure</h3>
    <p>If the BIT FAIL light illuminates flashing:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>Attitude indicators and annunciator lights - Check.</p>
        <p>Check attitude indicators and the annunciator panel caution lights (ANS REF/INS REF).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ATT REF SELECT switch - Cycle.</p>
        <p>Cycling the switch to the other attitude source and back will recycle a transient failure.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the BIT FAIL light continues to flash:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="3">
      <li>
        <p>ATT REF SELECT switch - Select other attitude source, if desired.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Autopilot Failure</h1>
    <p>If the pitch axis and/or the roll axis of the autopilot will not engage, the ATT REF SELECT switch must be cycled to reset the DAFICS software; otherwise, the autopilot cannot be reengaged.</p>
    <p>If the autopilot will not engage:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li class="applic-all-all">
        <p>Attitude indicators and annunciator lights - Check.</p>
        <p>Check attitude indicators and the annunciator panel caution lights (ANS REF/INS REF).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ATT REF SELECT switch - Cycle.</p>
        <p>Cycling the switch to the other attitude source and back will reset the DAFICS software and permit reengagement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Autopilot - Engage.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>DAFICS Computer Failures</h1>
    <p>The A CMPTR OUT, B CMPTR OUT, and M CMPTR OUT caution lights on the pilot's annunciator panel indicate DAFICS computer failures. To reset a computer, momentarily position the corresponding CMPTR RESET switch up and release it. The up position interrupts power to the computer. Releasing the switch restores power and reinitiates computer self-test; the computer will not reset if a fault is detected.</p>
    <p>Report all computer failures even if reset was successful.</p>
    <h3>Single Computer Out</h3>
    <p>If the A or B CMPTR OUT annunciator caution light illuminates, computer system redundancy is lost; however, no DAFICS systems are degraded.</p>
    <p>With A, B, or M DAFICS computer failed, the forward bypass door duct pressure ratio (DPR) schedule for automatic inlet operation is biased slightly lower on both inlets. The lower DPR schedule causes the forward bypass doors to open slightly and provides increased margin from unstart. The DPR schedule returns to normal if the computer resets.</p>
    <p>If the M CMPTR OUT annunciator caution light illuminates, M PTA inputs are lost and the beta (sideslip) value will go to zero. Auto inlet scheduling will not be biased for sideslip and unstarts are likely if the aircraft is yawed. Also, the computer input to the CIP barber pole is disabled and the reference needle displays zero. Altitude change is disabled and IFF MODE C will continue to report the altitude at the time of failure. TAS to the Pilot's &amp; RSO's map projector automatic map rate at the time of failure will continue to be used. DAFICS related signals to the DMRS are disabled. The altitude and TAS values at the time of failure will continue to be sent to the ANS and affects the following:</p>
    <ol class="list-cparnumber">
      <li>
        <p>DEAD RECKON MODE (TAS to ANS computer).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>NAV V/H source (altitude from ANS to V/H).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>RADAR ALTITUDE (altitude from ANS to CAPRE SLR).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Single Computer Out Procedure</h2>

    <h3>A And B Computers Out, M Computer Operative</h3>
    <p>If only the A and B CMPTR OUT lights illuminate, only the M computer is operating. If the A or B computer cannot be reset, revert to use of pitot-static instruments. If A and B CMPTR OUT caution lights illuminate, both inlets revert to restart unless in manual control. Use the Schedule For Manual Inlet Control, Figure 3-5, for supersonic cruise &amp; descent, and subsonic operation. Refer to Figure 3-16 for the list of operative equipment.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <ul class="list-circle">
        <li>
          <p>With A and B CMPTR OUT lights illuminated, both the APW and High Alpha Warning systems are inoperative, but the APW annunciator light will not illuminate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The APW stick shaker and pusher are disabled while the APW annunciator light is on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The APW stick pusher is disabled when any two DAFICS computers are inoperative.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>If DAFICS detects a 2 PTA failure, both the 2 PTA CHAN OUT and the APW annunciator caution lights illuminate. Refer to the 2 PTA Channels Out procedure, this section.</p>
    <p>If the APW switch is OFF, the High Angle of Attack Warning system stick shaker will continue to operate. The High Alpha Warning system shaker limits are 14° when below Mach 1.55, and 8° when above Mach 1.55. The High Alpha Warning system may be unreliable if the 2 PTA CHAN OUT annunciator light illuminates.</p>
    <p>The ADI pitch boundary indication continues to operate with the APW switch OFF. However, it should be considered unreliable if the APW light was illuminated before the APW switch was OFF or any of the following caution light combinations exist:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc">
      <li>
        <p>2 PTA CHAN OUT</p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Hydraulic power for APW stick pusher is lost if the A Hydraulic system fails.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The stick pusher assembly is a hydraulically powered piston. A solenoid valve on the assembly allows A hydro pressure to extend the piston when it receives an electrical signal from DAFICS. It is possible, through a series of failures in DAFICS, to have the stick pusher assembly extend. With an additional failure to retract, it would require 30 to 35 pounds pull force on the control stick to overpower the stick pusher spring; the control stick trigger and APW control switch would be ineffective. Inadvertent pusher activation could be particularly hazardous when supersonic or near the ground.</p>
    <p>
      <span>If the APW pusher extends, the elevons deflect 1.7° down from the trimmed position and the control stick moves 2.5° (1.5 inches) forward of neutral. A pull force on the stick of 30 to 35 pounds will be required to overpower the forward stick displacement. Pitch trim capability remains and can be used to retrim the elevons and relieve the stick force; however, the stick will remain approximately 2.5° (1.5 inches) forward of the original neutral position unless the pilot pulls aft with 30 to 35 pounds in addition to the normal stick force gradient. No abnormal force is required to move the stick</span>
      <u>forward</u>
      <span>of the new neutral position.</span>
    </p>
    <p>With trim indication at zero, the maximum manual up-elevon deflection is 10° (11.7° up from the new neutral position) with the APW pusher extended. This is due to mechanical limits in the mixer assembly. When the pusher is extended, the manual down-elevon deflection available, with trim indication at zero, remains 10° (8.3° down from the new neutral position).</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Immediately depress and hold the control stick trigger switch to deactivate the APW stick pusher if a false stick pusher activation occurs while close to the ground. If the stick pusher is not deactivated by the trigger, use a pull force of 30 to 35 pounds, in addition to normal stick forces, to overcome the stick pusher. Use pitch trim to relieve stick force.</p>

    <h4>TWO PTA CHANNELS OUT</h4>
    <p>If the 2 PTA CHAN OUT annunciator caution light illuminates, air data functions may be unreliable although they will continue to operate.</p>
    <p>If DAFICS detects a 2 PTA failure, both the 2 PTA CHAN OUT and the APW annunciator caution lights illuminate. The APW stick shaker and pusher are inoperative while the APW annunciator light is illuminated. The APW light may subsequently extinguish, but the 2 PTA CHAN OUT light will remain on until reset by maintenance personnel.</p>
    <p>TDI and alpha indications should be crosschecked against the pitot-static operated airspeed and altitude instruments. If the cross-check shows the TDI to be inaccurate, revert to pitot-static operated airspeed and altitude instruments for aircraft control. Inlet unstarts can be expected above Mach 1.6 if TDI and alpha information is unreliable; the AUTO PITCH TRIM essential ac circuit breaker should be pulled and the autopilot should be turned off. SAS gain schedules may be in error and could result in poor aircraft damping in all three aircraft axes. Caution should be exercised about magnitude of rudder motion and angle of attack excursions induced. If inlets unstart, use manual control, referring to the pitot-static Mach and altitude instruments. If inlets do not clear, use the Inlet Unstart procedure, this section.</p>
    <p>If all PTA self-check signals to the DAFICS computers fail, OFF flags appear in both TDIs. Air data functions are unreliable, although they may continue to operate.</p>

    <h4>AIR DATA MALFUNCTION</h4>
    <p>Each PTA (A, B, M) is powered by its respective (A, B, M) computer. When the M CMPTR OUT annunciator caution light illuminates, the M PTA is not powered and the beta (sideslip) value goes to zero. Appropriate procedures are included in DAFICS Computer Failure procedures, this section.</p>
    <p>
      <span>Sideslip angle data is only provided by the M PTA. If sideslip data is erroneous, spike and door scheduling on</span>
      <u>both</u>
      <span>inlets will be biased excessively and may cause an unacceptable degradation in performance. If required, refer to Inlet Malfunction, this section.</span>
    </p>
    <p>If DAFICS is not receiving sideslip angle data from the M PTA (as determined by PTA self test), or the sideslip angle from the M PTA is unreasonably high (as determined by comparison with the yaw SAS lateral accelerometers), the angle of sideslip used for automatic inlet operation computations is zero and the DPR schedules for both inlets are biased slightly lower. Auto inlet scheduling will not be biased for sideslips, and unstarts are likely if the aircraft is yawed significantly. If unstarts occur, refer to Inlet Unstart and Inlet Malfunction, this section.</p>
    <p>If air data malfunctions are not associated with DAFICS computer failures, refer to Two PTA Channels Out procedure, this section.</p>
    <p>If accuracy of air data is suspect:</p>

        <p>Complete the 2 PTA Channels Out procedure.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Pitot-static System Malfunction</h1>
    <p>The pitot and static pressure sources for the TDI are separate from the pitot and static sources for the pilot's airspeed, altimeter and inertial-lead vertical speed indicator; however, both pitot and static pressures are sensed in the nose boom. Both of the pitotstatic sources may become inaccurate or inoperative from a common malfunction. In icing conditions, failure of the pitot heater may affect both systems (and angle of attack indication). The pitot probe also could be plugged by a foreign body.</p>

If the automatic and manual temperature controls are ineffective with AUTO manifold temperature selected, attempt to minimize suit vent air flow and increase suit air temperature. The pilot can use defog air to heat the forward cockpit. If these actions are not sufficient, shut off an air conditioning unit.

    <h1>Drag Chute System</h1>
    <h3>Drag Chute Unsafe Warning</h3>
    <p>If the DRAG CHUTE UNSAFE annunciator caution light illuminates because of power loss to both actuator motors, the chute could still be in a safe condition and would not have to be deployed. However, to verify that loss of power to the actuator motors has occurred and that the chute mechanism is safe (will not deploy inadvertently):</p>
    <p>While subsonic:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li>
        <p>Airspeed - Establish 275-295 KEAS</p>
        <p>Speeds between 275 and 295 KEAS assure failure of the chute canopy, panel and/or shroud lines. Deploying the chute at lower speeds (255 KEAS or less) may result in a successful (unwanted) deployment. Maximum power would be insufficient to overcome the drag and break away the chute.</p>
        <div class="warning">
          <p>Do not deploy the chute while supersonic.</p>

        <p>Break away is accompanied by a slight nose-up pitching motion and a momentary shock. The pilot may hear a loud noise as chute separation or failure occurs. Depending on the nature of the break away, shroud lines may remain attached and stream behind the aircraft.</p>
      </li>

    <h3>Gear Emergency Extension</h3>
    <p>The landing gear emergency extension system unlocks the landing gear uplocks and allows the landing gear to free-fall to the down-land-locked position. The landing gear handle should be placed in the DOWN position and the landing gear control circuit breaker should be pulled to permit emergency gear extension. If the landing gear handle cannot be placed DOWN and the landing gear CONT circuit breaker is not pulled, the landing gear will retract if there is pressure in the R hydraulic system. The time required for emergency gear extension is 60 to 90 seconds. The emergency landing gear release handle must be pulled approximately 9 inches for full actuation. If it is not fully actuated, one or more gear may fail to extend. Up to 65 pounds of force is required.</p>
    <p>If inability to extend the gear is due to a failure in the plastic knob on the landing gear control handle, slide the pin forward 1/4 inch to release a catch within the control handle mechanism, then push the gear handle down. Refer to Figure 3-17.</p>

    <h3>Partial Gear Landing</h3>
    <p>A landing with the nose gear retracted or with all gear up should not be attempted.

    <h4>MAIN GEAR FLAT TIRE LANDING</h4>
    <p>For a landing with one or more flat tires, turn the antiskid system off to obtain effective braking. With antiskid on, the brake system prevents spin-down of the inboard and outboard wheels of each truck. If either or both of these tires has failed, normal runway contact is not made and they tend to lock-up when braking is attempted. The antiskid system defeats the braking attempt by releasing brake pressure as soon as the wheel starts to spin down.</p>
    <p>Plan the landing for minimum gross weight, and touchdown on the good truck first on the side of the runway away from the flat tire(s). Little danger exists when landing at light weight if only one tire on a truck has failed, as the remaining tires have sufficient strength to support the aircraft. If two tires on a truck have failed, the third may fail during the roll-out because of the overload.</p>
    <p>When all tires on a truck are known to have failed, apply enough brake pressure to lock all three wheels on that side. Maintain the pressure to prevent spin-up and the tire/wheel fragmentation that might result with rolling wheels. Use asymmetric braking (modulating the opposite side), nosewheel steering, and rudder and elevon roll inputs for directional control and stopping.</p>
    <p>Engine shutdown is not recommended unless critical for stopping. Do not shut down the engine on the downwind side if an appreciable crosswind exists. Left engine shutdown would require selection of the alternate brake system. Therefore, if a choice exists, landing into the wind or at least with the right engine into the crosswind is preferable. After S/B R-2695, if the left engine must be shut down, select the alternate brake system then depress and hold the trigger switch to disable antiskid.</p>
    <p>With all tires failed on both trucks, lock the wheels and skid to a stop rather than risk wheel fragmentation. Use the nosewheel and aerodynamic steering for directional control.</p>

    <h1>Landing Without Nosewheel Steering</h1>
    <p>It should be possible to stop safely without nosewheel steering when landing on a dry or grooved runway with crosswind components within recommended values. However, crosswinds combined with a slippery runway or damaged tire can be hazardous.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Do not overcontrol the aircraft on a slippery runway and start a lateral skid. The reduced side reaction force capability of the main gear tires may result in a "break out" and slide.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <span>Distinguish between aircraft heading and ground track. A lateral skid can develop if the main gear loses traction because of a slippery runway and/or damaged main gear tires. The ground track will probably diverge downwind. First, attempt to regain traction by steering into the skid. If this is successful, bring the heading back parallel to the runway centerline, then steer to the upwind side of the runway.</span>
      <u>Steer by applying roll control first</u>
      <span>. After full elevon deflection is reached, use rudder as necessary. Lateral stick deflection toward the desired direction of heading change should start a turn, but without the side force in the opposite direction which the rudders produce. Upwind rudder deflection produces a turn, but also results in a downwind rudder force which compounds the downwind skid problem.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Jettison the drag chute if roll control and use of the rudders fails to correct the ground track and it appears that the aircraft may slide off the runway. Otherwise, retain the drag chute.</p>
    <p>
      <span>If traction cannot be regained by turning into the skid, and if the ground track continues to diverge, try bringing the aircraft heading around so that it is well</span>
      <u>upwind</u>
      <span>of the ground track direction. This moves the relative wind to the other side of the nose, and puts the upwind weathercock force in the direction of the ground track. The thrust component of the idling engines tends to correct the track. If the aircraft continues to slide, the weathercock force will tend to rotate the heading back into the relative wind.</span>
      <u>Use roll control first,</u>
      <span>then the rudders, to keep the heading upwind and maintain a track on the runway. Use differential braking whenever main gear traction can be regained.</span>
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <p>
        <span>Asymmetric thrust is not recommended for directional control because of the difficulty expected in obtaining a controlled and timely response. Lateral stick and rudder steering should be adequate to control aircraft</span>
        <u>heading</u>
        <span>. However, if an otherwise irretrievable drift has developed, short bursts of equal thrust on both engines may correct the ground track to stay on the runway for barrier engagement. Thrust is in the proper direction to help regain runway position.</span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>The effects of the weathercock force and aerodynamic steering with the elevons and rudders is shown by Figure 3-18 for a heavy crosswind combined with a slippery runway and ineffective nosewheel steering.</p>
    <h1>Flat Strut Landing</h1>
    <p>The initial indication of a flat strut on landing is a 5° - 10° wing low condition after touchdown, and a directional control characteristic similar to that for crosswinds. Directional control may be difficult. The wingsnot-level attitude is similar to that for all tires blown on one side and causes uneven loading of the inboard and outboard tires on each truck. This may result in wheel spindown for the more lightly loaded tires during braking. Protracted cycling of the antiskid system can occur and result in reduced braking effectiveness if the antiskid system is not turned off. When brakes are applied, the lightly loaded tires may blow out.</p>
    <figure>

      <figcaption>Figure 3-18: Effects Of Weathercock Force And Aerodynamic Steering On Crosswind Landing Without Nosewheel Steering</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>After stop, clear the runway and wait for assistance. If inflation of the strut is not possible, the other strut should be deflated to 1" clearance to reduce side loads during aircraft movement. Slow taxiing is permitted; however, towing is recommended.</p>

    <h1>Gear Down Air Refueling</h1>
    <p>During air refueling rendezvous, airspeed must be monitored to prevent exceeding landing gear limits. Engine response is very rapid; therefore, throttle movements just prior to and during contact should be less than those used at normal refueling altitudes.</p>
    <h1>Cockpit Fog</h1>
    <h3>Cockpit Defogging</h3>
    <p>The possibility of cockpit fogging exists when ambient humidity is high. When the ambient air is cooled below its dew point temperature, moisture condenses into fog. Fogging will be most noticeable near sea level when near Military rpm. Under these conditions, the rate of airflow into the cockpit is greatest and the air may be cooled to as low as 37°F.</p>
    <h2>Cockpit Temperature Control</h2>
    <p>To eliminate cockpit fog, raise the temperature of the cockpit air to evaporate the moisture. This can be accomplished by either manual or automatic control of cockpit temperature.</p>
    <h2>AUTO TEMP Control Positioning</h2>
    <p>If cockpit fog is anticipated due to high ambient humidity, attempt to set the automatic temperature control to maintain cockpit temperature at or slightly above ambient temperature while the engines are at a high rpm. A little experimenting should establish a position on the AUTO TEMP selector that prevents excessive fogging. After takeoff, readjust the control for comfort. The same control position may be reestablished prior to landing to prevent fogging.</p>
    <h2>Water Separators</h2>
    <p>To minimize system pressure drop and to maintain maximum refrigeration capacity, the aircraft is not provided with a water separator in the cockpit air supply duct. A water separator in the cockpit system would cause considerable back-pressure at the cooling turbines. Water separators provided in the supply ducting to the ANS and mission equipment do not affect the overall refrigeration system performance. The equipment bays are not pressurized and additional pressure drop at these points does not raise the cooling turbine discharge pressure.</p>
    <p>If logging is encountered and increasing cockpit temperature is not practical:</p>
    <ol class="list-number">
      <li class="applic-SR71AB-aft">
        <p>
          <b>COCKPIT AIR OFF.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Position the cockpit air handle off (forward).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Right refrigeration switch - OFF.</p>
        <p>Turn both refrigeration switches off if the cockpit air handle is inoperative; however, this will result in loss of cooling air to the ANS and requires ANS shutdown.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If cockpit fog persists:</p>
    <ol class="list-number" start="3">
      <li>
        <p>Defog switch - OPEN, then HOLD.</p>
        <p>Defog hot air is available to raise the cockpit air temperature and evaporate the moisture, unless both refrigerators are turned off.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bay air switch - OFF.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cockpit temperature override switch - COLD 10 sec, then HOLD.</p>
        <p>This causes the cockpit temperature control valve to close and prevents excessive hot air from entering the cold air manifold.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Damaged Air Refueling Receptacle</h1>
    <p>If the air refueling receptacle is damaged, or if streaming fuel is reported after landing, make a complete stop on the runway and attempt to obtain precautionary assistance from fire fighting personnel and equipment before taxiing. If immediate taxiing is necessary to clear the runway, accomplish the turn at slow speed to minimize fuel spillage. Fuel sloshing from a damaged receptacle can be ingested by an inlet if taxi speed is not minimized while turning.</p>
    <h1>Warning Lights System</h1>
    <p>Illumination of any light(s) on the annunciator panels indicates an abnormal or emergency operating condition, or a situation deserving special attention. A summary of the lights and recommended actions is provided in Figure 3-19.</p>
    <h1>Tactical Limits</h1>
    <h2>Normal Restrictions vs Tactical Limits</h2>
    <p>If the crew finds the normal operating-restrictions unacceptable because of operations in a hostile area, the pilot is authorized to use the tactical limits listed in Figure 3-20 to exit the hostile area by the most expeditious means.</p>
